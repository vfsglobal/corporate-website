              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Koh Samui</h3>
              <p>
                Being the second-largest island in Thailand, Koh Samui is an
                ideal place for the first-time tourist, families, honeymooners
                and yoga bunnies. Known for its extravagant resorts, luxury
                spas, chic bars and world-class restaurants, people come to Koh
                Samui to relax and unwind. The island is also home to several
                natural and man-made attractions like the Secret Buddha Garden,
                the Mummy Monk, and the beautiful Namuang Waterfall. Tourists
                can also visit the Fisherman’s Village and explore its Walking
                Street Market that comes to life every Friday in the old part of
                Bophut Beach.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Koh Tao</h3>
              <p>
                Meaning ‘Turtle Island’, Koh Tao is a mecca for scuba divers.
                The coral landscapes here are home to turtles, reef sharks,
                stingrays, barracudas and whale sharks. Popular dive sites here
                help you explore the underwater sculptures of Ocean Utopia, the
                wreck of HTMS Sattakut, Lighthouse Bay, Japanese Gardens,
                Chumphon Pinnacles and many more. There are dozens of diving
                shops that provide daily trips and training courses,
                particularly in Mae Haad. If you’re new to diving, you can sign
                up at a school there and get your Professional Association of
                Diving Instructors (PADI) or Scuba Schools International (SSI)
                Open Water certification. These courses usually take up to four
                days and include four ocean dives. If you’re short on time, you
                can opt for the one-day Discovery Dives, where you can go down
                12 metres without certification.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Phuket</h3>
              <p>
                The biggest and busiest island in Thailand, Phuket is blessed
                with more than 30 amazing beaches to choose from. Patong Beach,
                Kata, Karon and Kamala have always been the most popular, but
                the north of the island reveals some hidden gems for travellers
                searching for a more romantic atmosphere. What makes Phuket
                different from the others is that it offers every luxury that a
                traveller can think of. Celebrity-chef restaurants, five-star
                resorts with private butlers, glitzy bars, Phuket has it all. A
                great one-day excursion is to Phang Nga Bay. A distinctive
                feature of the bay are the limestone cliffs with their sheen,
                that jut vertically out of the emerald-green waters. James Bond
                Island and Koh Panyee are two other famous spots in this bay.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Phi Phi Island</h3>
              <p>
                The island of choice for many solo travellers, Phi Phi will live
                up to all your expectations. This small archipelago consists of
                six islands: Koh Phi Phi Leh, Koh Bida Nok, Koh Bida Nai, Koh
                Phai (Bamboo Island), Koh Young (Mosquito Island) and Koh Phi
                Phi Don, the largest and only human-inhabited island of the
                group. Phi Phi is known for having various activities on
                offer—diving, snorkelling, cliff-jumping, boat trips, you’re
                spoilt for choice. As the waters around the island are home to a
                number of innocuous black-tip and leopard sharks, shark-watching
                tours have gained much popularity. These tours start early in
                the morning and end by mid-day. While you can spend the day
                indulging in adventure activities, you can spend your evening
                shopping for t-shirts, souvenirs and other accessories at the
                Tonsai East Shopping Alleyway.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Similan Islands</h3>
              <p>
                A place loved by adventurists and naturists, Similan Islands are
                numbered north to south, one to nine, and form a national park
                in the Andaman Sea. You can swim over untouched coral reefs in
                the turquoise waters and then step on to the white sand beaches
                of Koh Miang (known as ‘number four’) which has simple bamboo
                bungalows. The largest island Koh Similan (number eight)
                measures around five sq. km and is highly distinguishable
                because of the strange rock that is shaped like Donald Duck that
                overlooks the famous Donald Duck bay. Koh Similan is the main
                island here that attracts the most tourists because it has an
                average water depth of just over 25 metres, making it ideal for
                snorkelling and diving. It also has a fantastic nature trail up
                the highest mountain of the Mo Ku National Park.
