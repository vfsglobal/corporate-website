                <strong>Zagreb (Croatia)</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Consistently voted the best European Christmas Market for a few years in a row, Croatia’s capital Zagreb has
                a rocking time during Christmas.</p>
              <p>The whole city turns into a winter wonderland and festivities are held non-stop for several weeks. A beautiful
                ice sculpture festival, brass bands, fun fairs, a massive ice skating rink – Zagreb seems to pull out the stops
                for the magical season. </p>
              <p>The many squares in this ancient town play to Christmas markets and each has its own highlight. But the one at
                Jelacic Square with shops selling gingerbread hearts, traditional Croatian wine and liquour, souvenirs and
                decorations made by craftsmen, stands out from the rest.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Prague (Czech Republic)</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Prague any time of the year is a fabulous place to visit. Its charms and allure go up manifold during Christmas
                when the whole city becomes a winter wonderland. But among all the places to see and be in is Wenceslas Square
                which is home to one of the most fabulous Christmas markets. </p>
              <p>There’s an array of food and beverages sold here but the things to look out and savour include traditional Czech
                food such as barbecued pork, blood sausages, Czech muffins, beer, mulled wine, mead and such others. </p>
              <p>Once you’ve had your fill of these treats, wander around the other stalls comprising wood-carved toys, glass-work
                ware, blacksmith’s ware, baked goods and confectionery.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Dresden (Germany)</strong>
              </p>
              <p>It is usually believed that the tradition of Christmas markets began in Germany some time in the 14
                <sup>th</sup> century and spread everywhere from there. It is especially charming and vibrant in the Saxony region
                and Dresden perhaps has the most beautiful markets of all. More than 10 markets come up all over town and visitors
                are spoilt for choice as each of them has a theme.</p>
              <p>From setting and traditions popular in medieval times to winter and alpine themes, they spread a whole gamut.
                A plethora of choirs, concerts and gospel performances form part of the festivities each day. In addition,
                almost all of Dresden’s churches are decorated and the whole city glows under the magic of Christmas lights.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Copenhagen (Denmark)</strong>
              </p>
              <p>In Copenhagen, Christmas is celebrated as Jul (a derivate from the word yuletide) but its most famous Christmas
                market, including light-bedecked Christmas trees, is inside the magical Tivoli Gardens.</p>
              <p> The highlight of course is that nearly four miles of lights are hung in beautiful designer patterns, as well
                as draped on the lakeside willows. </p>
              <p>Wander around soaking up the spirit and feast on aebleskiver (iced doughnuts filled black currant jam) and glogg,
                a steaming hot mulled red wine infused with the flavour of dry fruits such as raisins, nuts and spices such
                as cinnamon and cloves, or steeped in schnapps. </p>
              <p>If you want a change of scene, head to the incredibly beautiful Nyhavn or new harbour with its colourful 17
                <sup>th</sup> century buildings.</p>

                <strong>London (Britain)</strong>
              </p>
              <p>London is so sprawling and spread out that there are a plethora of Christmas markets that come up during the
                season, and many of them have interesting and unique themes. And while it is quite difficult to see all of
                them, some are worth visiting more than the others. </p>
              <p>The Southbank market is filled with chalets selling many kinds of hand-crafted gifts alongside fun rides and
                the combination is irresistible even for adults. </p>
              <p>The German Christmas market at Leicester Square is colourful and vigorous with entertainment programmes, circus
                performances and dancers, as well as a Santa’s Grotto which is a hit with children.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Edinburgh (Scotland)</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Set against the backdrop of the majestic and imposing Edinburgh Castle, the Christmas market here is arguably
                a spectacular one, liter ally. While it has all the usual trappings of mulled wine and hot treats, there’s
                also six weeks of light shows, fireworks, funfairs and Europe’s largest outdoor ice rink. In addition, there
                are traditional Scottish crafts, handmade wooden and glass items and a host of other stalls.</p>

                <strong>New York (USA)</strong>
              </p>
              <p>It might be a difficult task to choose which Christmas market to go to in New York since scores of them come
                up all over the city but the one at Union Square is probably the best of the lot, with a predominantly New
                York theme.</p>
              <p> More than 150 vendors sell artisanal foods, holiday ornaments, hand-blown glassware, bags, handmade jewellery,
                and children’s toys under iconic red and white tents. And then ther e’s the funky bits as well, such as articles
                made from recycled plastic.</p>
              <p> If all the browsing and shopping makes you hungry, then head to one of the many delectable food stalls for typical
                street fare and sip on hot apple cider.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Chicago (USA)</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Possibly one of the strongest Germanthemed Christmas markets in the country, the Christkindlmarkt in Chicago
                is a must-visit this season.</p>
              <p>Sample a range of over 70 types sausages including weisswurst, frankfurter, and currywurst. Underscoring the
                German theme are cuckoo clocks from the Black Forest region, glass ornaments from Lauschaer, and wood carvings
                from Erzgebirge. In addition to all the staples such as mulled wine, fun activities for children and plenty
                of stores to browse through, don’t forget to buy the annual mug which changes every year in design, shape and
                colour.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Held in the historic Distillery District, the Toronto Christmas Market is the re-creation of a charming European
                Christmas market with a few Canadian twists. </p>
              <p>It is made lively with Bavarian brass bands and folk dancers from such places as Slovenia and Ukraine. </p>

              </p>
              <p>The Vancouver Christmas Market at Jack Poole Plaza epitomises Vancouver’s moniker as the ‘world in a city’ for
                its rich ethnic diversity.</p>
