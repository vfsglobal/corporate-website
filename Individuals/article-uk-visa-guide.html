              <p>The United Kingdom is amongst the most frequently visited destinations for travellers in the world.
                What adds to UK’s allure is its proximity with the Schengen region that opens up seamless tourism opportunities for travellers if they combine their UK travel with a visit to continental Europe, to behold its many brilliant landscapes and landmarks. In order to make your UK visa application process hassle-free and convenient, UK Visas and
                Immigration and VFS Global offer you an exclusive array of value-added services. </p>
              <p>This is in addition to the Premium Lounge facility and the On Demand Mobile Visa services available at the UK visa application centres. </p>
              <p>Choose from any of these time-saving services: </p>

              <p><strong>Walk In Without Appointment</strong></p>
              <p>Missed your scheduled appointment or need to travel urgently? You can simply opt to Walk In Without An Appointment and go to any UK Visa Application Centre to submit your visa application.</p>
              <p>This service is useful for applicants who cannot make it for their booked appointments, either due to changed circumstances, or if the reserved timeslot is no longer convenient to them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Keep Your  Passport  When  Applying</strong></p>
              <p> If you need to apply for multiple visas, such as a UK / Schengen combination, or wish to make a short trip while waiting for your UK visa to be processed,</p>
              <p>you will find the ‘Keep My Passport When Applying’ service at the UK Visa Application Centre very helpful. After enrolling your biometrics and submitting your visa application at the UK visa application centre, if you have opted for this service, your passport is handed back to you.</p>
              <p>This is extremely useful if you
                want to carry on with another country’s visa application formalities, as this service allows you to keep your passport with you. </p>
              <p>You can keep your passport with you until the UK embassy makes a decision regarding your visa, one way or the other.</p>
              <p>Once the decision is made, you will be called once again to complete the procedures as required by the embassy.</p>
              <p>The visa application centres of UK and Schengen countries are often conveniently located next to each other at the VFS Global centres. This facility enables applicants to finish the visa formalities of multiple countries along with that of UK in a single day.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Super Priority and Priority Visas</strong></p>
              <p>Need a visa at short notice? The Super Priority and Priority Visa services are options for those who need to travel urgently.</p>
              <p>For Priority Visa applicants, the process takes 3–5 days, while for Super Priority Visa applicants, this speeds up to a single business day. Super Priority Visa Service is available at VFS Global’s UK visa application centres in New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. Do note that the eligibility for application for either of these services may vary.</p>
