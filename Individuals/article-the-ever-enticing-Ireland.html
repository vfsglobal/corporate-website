              <p>Ireland holds within its reaches a rich history, vibrant culture, welcoming people and a plethora of sweeping views and exciting activities to experience when visiting. From city breaks to sprawling countryside retreats, Ireland offers travellers a mix of holiday options to suit a variety of needs—from the solo travel to family holidays, and even outlets for the social energiser.</p>
              <p>Dublin, the thriving capital of the Republic of Ireland, is likely the most well-known city. From visiting the Guinness Storehouse, offering its insightful brewery expertise and Temple Bar, with its lively dining scene and electric undercurrent, to the lesser-known yet equally fascinating, Marsh’s Library with some of its literature dating back to the early 1400’s, guests are spoilt for choice when it comes to potential avenues for adventure. The little ones will also have their hands full, as they can delight in the family-friendly museums and tours, like the Viking Splash Tour, as well as the enchanting Chocolate Warehouse, where they can learn about the history of their favourite food.</p>
              <p>Another bustling city to explore is Galway, which serves up an array of intriguing activities to guests, from tours of acclaimed monuments such as the Dunguaire Castle, a 16th century masterpiece to those harbouring a love for wildlife enjoying a day at Burren Nature Sanctuary or Loughwell Farm Park. Both the places are a short drive out of the city. You can also experience the marvellous collection of marine life at Galway Aquarium, Ireland’s National Aquarium. Those in search of fantastic vistas can hop aboard ferries to the beautiful Aran Island or drive to the Cliffs of Moher, where they can look out across the seemingly endless Atlantic Ocean.</p>
              <p>Amongst one of the friendliest cities in Ireland, Cork is another eclectic option not to be missed when visiting the Emerald Isle. Visitors can make their way to Garnish Island, which boasts a microclimate unlike any other the island, enabling it to shelter a unique variety of plants and wildlife. On the way is a special treat for all in the form of Seal Island, home to fur seals, rare birds and the occasional dolphin. The Model Railway Village will be a hit with the little ones as they watch miniature trains make their way through exact replicas of well-known towns and villages. For a truly wondrous experience, adventurers can take to the water for a spot of nighttime kayaking at Lough Hyne, where each paddle stroke will bring to life the enrapturing shine of bioluminescent plankton.</p>
              <p>For the avid explorers, Ireland has a number of captivating niche cultural offerings, such as its grand castles, including Ashford Castle, a 5 star Hotel in Co. Mayo, one of Ireland’s most visited castles. Originally built in the 13th century, it’s become a global icon of luxury accommodation. Besides its opulent interior, the estate is a vision during the fall when its magnificent ancient woodlands explode with colour. Guests can try their hand at an extensive range of activities available on the property; from Orvis fly fishing to Ireland’s first school of falconry. Adare Manor is considered to be one of the most opulent hospitality experiences in the world, offering elegant interiors, lush lawns and exquisite gourmet dining options. Located in Limerick, it provides guests with a relaxing stay in luxurious surroundings. A more distinctive option is to embark on a journey on board the Belmond Grand Hibernian, promising stylish contemporary interiors as the picturesque views of the surrounding scenery flash by. The train deftly weaves touches of Georgian design into its modern appeal, which when combined with the quintessentially warm Irish hospitality, make for a truly unforgettable stay.</p>
              <p>Golfing getaways are a favourite in Ireland, which is home to one quarter of all the world’s link courses. The North West Golf Course is one such hidden gem, presenting golfing enthusiasts with an extensive 18-hole experience, tucked within the rugged landscape of County Donegal. Another world-class golfing experience is presented by The Palmer Ryder Cup Course, recognised the world over as one of the greatest golf courses on the European circuit. Located at The K Club Hotel in County Kildare, the course is known to put even the most accomplished of players through their paces, as players find themselves taking on the wits of the legendary Arnold Palmer, the namesake and designer of the golfing heaven. </p>
