                France
              </h3>
              <p>One of the oldest wine-producing countries in the world, France has several wine regions and appellations
                that have GI tags such as Champagne. Of these, Bordeaux and Burgundy are the most beautiful. Both are
                known for their reds and the whole area is a blanket of vineyards with the air thick with the smell of
                grapes and wines. Visit places such as Cote D’Or area in Burgundy or visit little charming villages such
                as St Emilion near Bordeaux.</p>

                Italy</h3>
              <p>Neighbours Italy and France have always been rivals where wine production is concerned, with a wine a
                tradition going back centuries in both countries. But Italy has something more going for it – the
                spectacular scenery of Tuscany area, which is also one of the most prominent wine-producing regions.
                Rolling countryside and vineyards stretching to the horizon are interspersed with stunning architecture
                and charming villages and towns. Some of the wines to try here include Montepulciano.

                Georgia
              </h3>
              <p>Talk about European wine and Georgia hardly comes to mind! And therein lies the charm of Georgian wine.
                Considered to be among the oldest wine-producing countries in Europe, Georgia has flown under the radar.
                But in an age when wine connoisseurs are looking for variety, the country’s wine scores high. Especially
                eye-catching is the Kakheti area in Georgia, which is considered to be the birthplace of wine. Georgian
                wine is also unique because the grapes, along with skin, stalk, and pips are fermented in huge clay pots
                that are buried underground for almost an entire year. The result is a wine that is exquisite on the
                palate and refreshingly heady. </p>

                Australia
              </h3>
              <p>Among the new age wines, Australian wines hold their own and the country is the fifth largest wine
                exporter in the world. While almost all states have regions producing wines, it is the southern part that
                is more popular and produces some of the best varieties owing to a climate suited for wine production.
                Among them, Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley in Victoria, Barossa in South Australia and Hunter
                Valley in New South Wales are some really well-known wine regions carpeted with vineyards and filled with
                wineries. These are home to brands like Penfolds, Jacob’s Creek, Chandon etc.</p>

                Argentina
              </h3>
              <p>Highly regarded among the new world wines, Argentinean wine is the toast of wine connoisseurs the world
                over. It is mostly known for its Malbec wines, which are popping up on tables across the world. Of all the
                wine regions, Mendoza is most famous since its high altitude and perfect weather for grapes has resulted
                in over 1,000 wineries making it their home. Vineyards climbing up and down the hillsides make for a
                spectacular sight. </p>

                New Zealand
              </h3>
              <p>Lesser known but gaining a foothold across the world’s tables is New Zealand wine. Though both islands
                have wine regions, Central Otago area in South Island is eye-catching and has a GI of its own. Spanning
                gentle valleys and hill slopes, aided by beautiful lakes and rivers that run through the region, the
                vineyards are spectacular and produce some of the best New Zealand pinot noirs. What makes the area
                endearing is that it is filled with small growers producing some of the most beautiful wines. Some
                wineries worth a visit include Mt Difficulty, Misha’s Vineyard, Scott Base, Wooing Tree and Aurum. </p>

It is associated with aspiration and sophistication. But in recent years, wine has undergone a lot of transformation. It has lost much of its snob value and acquired a fun element as newer regions have emerged and the taste palate has expanded and diversified. While old world favourites still rule the roost, new-age wines from younger regions are storming the wine scene. Here’s a list of world’s regions, a mix of old and new, that are worth visiting for both the wines and the scenery."
