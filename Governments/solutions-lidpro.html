			main_content: [
				[
					"<strong>Location-independent visa processing:</strong> LIDPro™ safely collects and transfers visa applications anywhere in the world, irrespective of time zone differences.",
				
					"<strong>Business continuity:</strong> LIDPro™ is not disrupted through any interruption of services caused by industrial or environmental factors. LIDPro™ allows back-ups, archives, offers offsite storage, and disaster recovery options so that content is always available on demand and business continuity is assured.",
				
					"<strong>Collaborative processing:</strong> Location Independent Document Processing offers a workflow and role-based collaborative environment - all the stakeholders can work on the same set of documents simultaneously.",
				
					"<strong>Increased productivity:</strong> LIDPro™ is a technologically advanced solution that standardises processes, automates low-value processes, frees up resources to execute high-value tasks, supports flexible work hours, and makes visa application time and locationindependent. All these translate to enhanced Productivity for the client governments."
				],
				
				[
					"<strong>e-Docket archival and on-demand retrieval:</strong> Electronic collection of documents through LIDPro™ facilitates archival and retrieval at any point using multiple metadata including name, surname, unique identification number, passport number, etc.",
				
					"<strong>Work allocation and workload balancing:</strong> Unique work allocation functionalities of LIDPro™ can help a diplomatic mission network manage pools of e-dockets and their distribution, using a common “work queue” for all involved posts to balance and evenly distribute workloads, and create roles based on individual capabilities.",
				
					"<strong>Flexible & Customisable:</strong> The LIDPro™ solution can be customised to incorporate different workflows and user interface specifications to suit various requirements of Client Governments. The ability to work with legacy browser versions and accommodate bandwidth restrictions are some of the features that make this solution highly adaptable.",
				
					"<strong>Reduced operating costs:</strong> Apart from significant cost reductions felt through not having to set-up and operate permanent centres across multiple locations, cost-efficiencies are also incurred from the transfer of e-documents rather than physical applications via LIDPro™."
