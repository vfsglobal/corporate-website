                Beirut Beckons
              </h3>
              <p>
                Being a relatively small country, you can base yourself in the capital city of Beirut and do day trips to other cities as most places can be reached within 2.5 hours of driving. With the sobriquet Paris of the Middle East, Beirut has amazing buildings whose architecture is marvelous. Start your exploration by visiting two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Beqaa Valley - the ruins of Baalbek and Anjer. The Jupiter Temple at Baalbek, dedicated to the cult of Zeus, is one of the largest Roman temples in the world. Some other important temples here include the one dedicated to Bacchus, the Greek god of wine and the Temple of Venus. To see a fine example of the Ummayyad era architecture ruins of the Great Palace of Anjer is a must see.

                The National Museum of Beirut that houses exhibits from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period is a good way to understand the history of the region. Pay a visit to the Banque du Liban Museum that has an interesting display of all things currency and is a good way to understand all about coins and money. To spend a chilled out evening in Beirut head to some of their epic clubs or visit Mar Mikhael and Gourad/Armenia Street that have many bars and restaurants. The corniche here is a great way to spend the evening. Do check the Raouche Sea Rock or Pigeon Rock along the coastline a natural rock formation that makes for a stunning visual in the water.
