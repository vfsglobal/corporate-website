              <p>How often do we find ourselves in front of a map, confused about where do we want to go next? Celebrities are no different. While they might be living out of a suitcase when working, some also get excited thinking about their next vacation. In case you are in a dilemma over where to spend the summer of 2019, you may want to take cues from some of the favoured destinations of Bollywood stars.</p>

                Switzerland
              </h3>
              <p>From Yash Chopra to Shah Rukh Khan, from Anil Kapoor to Madhuri Dixit Nene, Switzerland has always been
                the playground of the whoâ€™s who of Bollywood. It provides respite from the oppressive heat to those that
                love the pristine white snow. The Nawab of Bollywood, Saif Ali Khan and his begum Kareena Kapoor Khan have
                made no secret that Gstaad is their favourite holiday spot. The two make a pilgrimage here every year,
                with or without family and friends. Planning a summer holiday in Switzerland may just make you bump into
                them, you never know!</p>

                London</h3>
              <p>London tops the list of everyone who likes to spend their hard-earned moolah for shopping. Karan Johar,
                Shah Rukh Khan, Sonam Kapoor, and many others regularly make the bee-line for some time of semi-anonymity
                in Hyde Park as well. With the frenzy around the ICC Cricket World Cup, London will be the most popular
                spot this summer.</p>

                New York
              </h3>
              <p>New York is another shopping paradise for the glam-brigade of Bollywood. But Ranbir Kapoor, Kangana
                Ranaut, Siddharth Malhotra and many others also travel there to experience the buzz of the city. Surely
                with the many things to do, it is an ideal holiday option.</p>

                Spain
              </h3>
              <p>Speaking of European escapades, ever since the band of boys in Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara discovered the
                seduction of this glorious country, intrepid travellers like Taapsee Pannu, Neha Dhupia and Prabhas have
                succumbed to the charms of Spain. Apparently, Katrina Kaif is working out finer details of an expensive
                family holiday here. Well that is just one more reason to choose Spain as a summer getaway.

                The Maldives
              </h3>
              <p>Beaches are the best summer vacation spots. After Ajay Devgn spent an extensive holiday, replete with
                surf, sun and sand at Soneva Kiri, the island destination is buzzing as one of the most popular holiday
                spots for 2019. Apparently Malaika Arora also set the waves on fire recently. With or without her beau, a
                certain burly Kapoor? We are not saying!</p>
