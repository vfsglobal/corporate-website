              <p>In recent years, Slovakia has emerged as an attractive tourist destination. Notwithstanding its small
                size, the country located in central Europe is replete with abundant bounties of nature. The nation boasts
                of scenic mountains, national parks, natural caves, rivers and much more, making the country a favourite
                for those fond of nature. The country also has a rich heritage with its historical and archaeological
                sites. His Excellency <strong>Mr. Ivan Lančarič</strong>, the Ambassador of the Slovak Republic to India, speaks about the
                tourism potential of his country and offer many tips for travellers planning to visit Slovakia.</p>

                Tell us a little bit about what tourists can explore in Slovakia.
              </h3>
              <p>When you compare Slovakia to India, we are really small because the size of our country is just about
                50,000 sq km. But even though we are relatively small, you can find almost everything in Slovakia: about
                120 medieval castles, almost 4,200 churches and cathedrals, nine national parks, more than 7,000 natural
                caves, 1,600 mineral and thermal springs, 40 spas and aquaparks, more than 50 ski resorts with hundreds of
                cable cars, almost 150 wineries. We can boast of a total of 30 records in the UNESCO list of world
                heritage. Not to mention about dozens of festivals, cultural events, galleries, museums and nightlife of
                course. You can find everything in Slovakia, maybe except the sea. </p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">
                Has tourism been on the rise in Slovakia?
              </h3>
              <p>In recent years, the Slovak Republic has become even more popular as a tourist destination. For example,
                in 2017 about 2.2 million foreign visitors came to Slovakia. This number is surely even higher, but
                statistics only include travellers staying in Slovakia at least for one night. If you take into
                consideration that the total number of Slovak citizens is only about 5.5 million, you will find our
                tourism sector remarkable. Tourism in Slovakia generates revenues of roughly 5 billion € every year, which
                represents 5.2% of our total GDP. </p>
            </li>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">
                What are the unique tourist destinations in Slovakia you would like to recommend?
              </h3>
              <p>To be honest, it is really difficult to recommend only a few, but I will suggest some tips to address
                everyone. For those who prefer nature, mountains and adventures, I would recommend our pride: High Tatra
                mountains, Slovak Paradise National Park as well as our famous Demänovská Ice Cave and Ochtinská Aragonite
                Cave that are listed in UNESCO. For those who want to see the history of medieval castles, there are
                Bojnice Castle, Red Rock Castle, Bratislava Castle, Spiš Castle, Orava Castle and many others. All of them
                are fully renovated and wonderful. Those who would like to get to know Slovak culture and traditions
                should visit our open air museums of traditional villages like Pribylina or Bardejov and of course they
                should not miss our traditional folk festival Východná every July.</p>

                What facets of tourism in your country do you think will appeal to Indians?
              </h3>
              <p>I believe that all of the above-mentioned. We understand that travel preferences are very individual.
                Someone might like mountains and nature, others might like history and culture, someone might prefer to
                enjoy nightlife... But as I explained, Slovakia really has something for everyone´s taste. Especially if
                you want to escape from the Indian summer heat and humidity or polluted air in winter, Slovak touristic
                resorts may offer you pleasant climate and fresh air during the whole year. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">
                How important is India as a market for tourism in your country? Currently how many Indians are visiting
                Slovakia per year and for what purposes?
              </h3>
              <p> Last year we recorded more than 11,000 Indians that visited our country and stayed there more than one
                night. In this regard, I would like to highlight that Indian tourists on average stayed on our territory
                more days than other tourists. But still, there is a huge potential and we believe that we will attract
                even more Indian visitors in the future. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">
                What are the new initiatives to attract Indian tourists?
              </h3>
              <p>Just recently we doubled visa capacity at the Embassy and launched the cooperation with VFS Global in three cities - Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, which adds to tripling the visa capacity as compared to 2018. Latest initiative was an event presenting Slovakia as a tourist destination organised by the Slovak Embassy on March 6. It was a very successful event and we are planning to organise more of them in the future, maybe even in collaboration with some agencies or organisations. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">
                Please tell us about the Slovak visa process for Indians. How easier is it to get Slovak visa?
              </h3>
              <p>Our visa issuing process has to strictly follow the Schengen Visa Code so we can say it is the same as in any other EU country. But at this point, I would like to recommend to any applicant: please, read the visa application instructions carefully and make sure everything in your application is correct and complete. Correct and complete application submitted in advance of the planned travel is likely to get easy and fast approval. Majority of Indian Schengen Visa applications in 2018 were business trips and average visa processing time was four calendar days. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">How is air-connectivity between the two countries? </h3>
              <p>There is a very convenient flight connection via Dubai to Bratislava, and also direct flights to Vienna airport which is just a half hour drive from our capital Bratislava. And from Bratislava, it takes only 2-3 hours of car ride to get to most of the above-mentioned beautiful sites, mountains and attractions. </p>

            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">How long have you been in India? What do you enjoy the most about it? </h3>
              <p>Together with my wife, we had arrived in June 2018 and since then we are trying to enjoy a variety of regional and traditional Indian cuisines. </p>
