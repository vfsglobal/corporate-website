                <strong>Lebanon is gaining steady momentum as a destination for Indians. Have you seen an increase in visas being issued
                in India? Can you give us a little bit more insight into what were the key factors that contributed to this
                growth?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, we have seen a significant growth in the number of visa applications since I have assumed charges. Networking
                with the Indian trade as well as the travel and tourism fraternity and promoting the destination has helped
                position Lebanon in the market. </p>
              <p>Lebanese authorities want more and more Indian tourists to visit the country. For this very reason we have streamlined
                the visa application process by collaborating with VFS Global, making the entire process easier and quicker.

                <strong>Are there any new initiatives in the pipeline to facilitate increase travel and tourism between India and Lebanon?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>We are looking to promote Lebanon in India as a major tourist attraction. We plan to collaborate with several
                trade partners. We also have many activities and initiatives in the pipeline.</p>

                <strong>Which are the major trends that you are witnessing in the Indian market? </strong>
              </p>
              <p>Indians are evolved travellers. They believe in experiential travel and now want to do things at their own pace.
                Travel is seen as a mode of self-realisation, exploration and experiencing different cultures and meeting new
                people. One of the clearest trends we are seeing is a willingness to explore new destinations.</p>

                <strong>In your opinion what is the best time to visit Lebanon? What are your top 5 must do’s while in Lebanon?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Lebanon is a year-round destination. In winter, one can enjoy snow activities. During spring, fall and summer,
                travellers can visit the coastal cities as well as experience the picturesque landscapes in the countryside.
              </p>
              <p>Travellers must indulge in the exquisite and delicate Lebanese cuisine.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Travel to Lebanon from India is mostly confined to two or three cities. Does the Embassy plan to work with
                the tourism board to improve dispersal of Indian travellers to other parts of Lebanon?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, we want tourists from all parts of India to witness the exquisite and serene Lebanon experience. In addition
                to the major metros and Tier I cities, we also plan to promote the destination in Tier II cities as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>How important is increase in air connectivity to improve tourist numbers on both sides?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Very important, unparalleled! Direct flights to Lebanon will definitely aid in the growth of travelers between
                the two countries.</p>

                <strong>How has your experience been so far in India? What are your favourite destinations within India?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, I haven’t had the opportunity to travel around much due to commitments at work. However I am looking
                forward to exploring the cultural, natural and historical beauty of this great civilization.</p>
