              <p>Taking control of your finances is one of the key requirements while you draw plans to move overseas.
                Whether you are moving to London, Beijing or Sydney, you can take proactive steps to make sure that
                finances are in place before you arrive at a foreign land.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Open an account before you arrive</h3>
              <p>In some instances, it is possible to set up a bank account before you arrive. This can be either an
                <a href="https://internationalservices.hsbc.com/" target="_blank">international bank account</a> that enables you to access multiple currencies, or a bank account to which you
                can apply online and then go into a branch when you land to verify your identity.</p>
              <p>Having an account set up allows you to transfer money so that it is available for you when you arrive.

            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Consider what you need</h3>
              <p>Before you leave, you may want to take a relook at your current financial situation. You may want to
                surrender a credit card that may no longer be required or close a bank account for similar reasons.</p>
              <p>Once you arrive, evaluate your financial requirements. The rules, regulations and requirements vary
                from one country to another. Therefore, one must do some research and study before opting for a financial
                product or service.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Select the best way to transfer</h3>
              <p>Deciding on the amount you need to transfer and the frequency of transfer may help you choose the best options. How much and how often you need to transfer may determine the best way for you to move your money.</p>
              <p>An <a href="https://internationalservices.hsbc.com/" target="_blank">international services</a> account will give you access to money in different currencies whenever you need, while an <a href="https://www.hsbc.co.uk/international/money-transfer/" target="_blank">International Money Transfer</a> gives you the flexibility to transfer a set amount at a set time â€“ or at regular intervals. You may also be able to link global accounts with some international banks, for example <a href="https://www.hsbc.co.uk/international/global-view-and-global-transfers/" target="_blank">HSBC Global View and Global Transfers</a> enables customers to quickly send money without a fee and also see all their international accounts in one place.</p>
