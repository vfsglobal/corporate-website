  <p>VFS Global started biometric enrolments in {{stats.biometric_inception}} for UK Visas and Immigration (formerly the UK Border Agency) in 33 countries. Many governments are now turning to biometric technology to help them achieve a balance between facilitation and security, and improve their visa, immigration and identity verification processes. </p>
  <p>VFS Global's biometric solutions are highly adaptable to suit a wide range of requirements, which include a Multi Mission Model approach, Single Tenancy Solutions, mobile biometrics (through a state-of-the-art Mobile Biometrics Kit) and authentication systems. Presently, VFS Globalâ€™s capabilities in biometrics also span across end-to-end Identity Management Solutions going much beyond enrolment services to deliver on the varying needs of each client.</p>
