              <p>Sustainability means being
                orientated towards the future,
                contributing to the society while
                ensuring long-term success of the
                business. Being an industry pioneer and
                leader, VFS Global has always acknowledged
                its responsibility towards conducting its
                operations in a socially responsible and
                ethically sound manner.</p>
              <p>The company has
                been active in the environment conservation
                space and in supporting social causes such
                as education for the under-privileged across
                the globe as part of its long-term Corporate
                Social Responsibility (CSR) activities.</p>
              <p>VFS Global is highly committed to create ‘Shared
                Value’ in areas where we have greatest
                intersection between VFS Global’s business
                and the society, and where we can create
                the most value and make most difference.</p>
              <p>VFS Global and its Swiss parent-company
                Kuoni Group are owned by international
                private equity company EQT, based in
                Sweden. In 2017 VFS Global has introduced
                EQT’s Environmental, Social and Governance
                (ESG) Roadmap to further extend and
                enhance the company’s CSR commitments
                and initiatives.</p>
