              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Dubai, a hop-over destination</h3>
              <p>Indians keep visiting this booming, safe and secure Gulf country to enjoy its shopping, recreation and adventure potential, and to meet up with family and friends, who oblige them with whirlwind tours through this mini paradise. For Indians, the UAE, and in particular Dubai, has become their home away from home, a hop-over destination for extended weekends and national holidays. </p>
              <p>The region’s wide range of attractions cater to the tastes of all varieties of holiday-makers. From the skyscrapers lining Sheikh Zayed Road, the world-class mega malls and multi-million-dollar offshore developments, to the Old World souks, beaches and adrenaline-charged desert safaris, Dubai has it all. </p>
              <p>Dubai is also a popular transit destination for travellers, owing to its geographically central location between Asia and Europe. Over the last decade, the UAE has seen a tremendous growth in the number of travellers from India. Even the hot summer months of July and August when outside is blazing hot, the cool air-conditioned malls in the UAE are flush with tourists, who come to partake in the Summer Surprises shopping bonanza.</p>
