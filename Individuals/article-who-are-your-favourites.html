              <p>
                The 2019 World Cup will be the fifth time that England have
                staged the World Cup. Having featured in every World Cup since
                the tournament was established in 1975 but have still to win it,
                England will look to make the most of this tournament. With
                their current form, England is surely one of the favourites to
                lift the trophy. However, they’ll have to be at their best from
                the start as they take on South Africa in the opener followed by
                Pakistan.

                Australia
              </h3>
              <p>
                The defending champions and five-time winners, Australia is the
                most successful country in the tournament’s history. In 2015,
                they beat New Zealand by seven wickets in the final. However,
                they have struggled for form since the team was caught up in a
                ball-tampering scandal that rocked the game last year. Apart
                from fixing their bowling, Australia also needs to sort out
                their middle order. Australia’s chances have improved after
                their ODI and T20 win over India. They face Afghanistan to open
                the World Cup.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">India</h3>
              <p>
                Under the leadership of Virat Kohli, India will enter the World
                Cup as favourites alongside England. Most players of the Indian
                team are in great form and they play well in England. Former
                Indian captain Sourav Ganguly also described India as favourites
                to lift the World Cup, saying the team is in best possible shape
                to win the quadrennial event which gets underway at England on
                May 30. India will begin its campaign at the World Cup with a
                clash against South Africa on June 5 at Southampton.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">New Zealand</h3>
              <p>
                The Kiwis has never won the World Cup, but they have come close
                to winning the prestigious trophy, having reached the semifinals
                on seven occasions and even made it to the final in the 2015
                edition, only to lose out to Australia. However, the current
                side has some world class players who can turn any game in their
                favour. While they’ve long been termed as dark horses (even
                Sachin said that New Zealand would be the dark horse this year),
                this time they might turn out to be serious contenders to lift
                the trophy.

                VFS Global, in association with UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI),
                has also launched a new Check and Verify service for UK visa

                for independent authentication, and have the verification report
                sent directly to UKVI. This service provides customers with a
                higher degree of assurance about the documents / information
                submitted, while giving greater confidence to UKVI about the
                genuineness of the document. In view of rising UK visa
                application volumes, the service will also strengthen the
                integrity and security of the visa process, by mitigating the
                influence of touts and risks of fraudulent applications.
