        <h3 class="big_heading padb_normal" id="transferringInformation">Transferring your information off-shore</h3>
        <p>As part of the services offered to you through this website, or in a Visa Application Centre, the information which you provide to us will, in most circumstances, be transferred to off-shore countries. This is because by applying for a visa or other type of travel document your personal information will be sent via the diplomatic mission to the country you are applying to visit.  These countries may not have similar information protection laws to your country or the EU. As part of the visa application process we will seek your consent to transfer your personal information “off-shore” even though it is a necessary part of the application process we are obliged by law to ask your permission to transfer your personal information.</p>
        <p>We may transfer your personal information, internally within VFS Global, to one of our data centres in the UK, Canada, Germany, India or Russia depending on which country you are in and applying to travel to. If we transfer personal information internally within VFS Global from one country to another country, where the data protection laws may not offer the same level of data privacy protection as in your home country, we take measures to provide an appropriate level of data privacy protection. In other words, your rights and protections remain with your data. For example, we use European Commission approved contractual clauses, and other measures designed to ensure that the recipients of your personal information protect it.</p>
        <p>If you would like to know more about our data transfer practices, please contact our <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#100;&#112;&#111;&#64;&#118;&#102;&#115;&#103;&#108;&#111;&#98;&#97;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#68;&#97;&#116;&#97;&#32;&#80;&#114;&#111;&#116;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#32;&#79;&#102;&#102;&#105;&#99;&#101;&#114;</a>.</p>

        <p>When you give us personal information, we take steps to ensure that it’s treated securely. Any sensitive information (such as credit or debit card details) is encrypted and protected. On our websites when you are on a secure page, a lock icon <img src="../assets/images/icons/privacy_policy_clip.png" alt=""> will appear on the in the address bar of most web browsers. This means the transfer of information from your browser to our webservers is encrypted to keep it safe.</p>
        <p>Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are transmitted normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our very best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. When you set-up an account, say for example when you book an appointment at a Visa application centre, you are responsible for keeping that account password confidential and we ask you not to share your password with anyone</p>
