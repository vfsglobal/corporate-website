                Tower of London
              </h3>
              <p>The Koh-i-Noor diamond is said to have obtained its name in 1738 in the aftermath of the Battle of Karnal
                in which Nadir Shah of Persia defeated Mohammed Shah, the Mogul ruler of India. Nadir Shah suggested that
                he and the vanquished ruler exchange turbans as a sign of goodwill, knowing from a member of the Mogul’s
                harem that he kept a diamond of legendary size in the folds of his headgear. When Nadir Shah later
                unravelled the turban, the stone fell onto his hands causing him to exclaim ‘Koh-I-Noor’ meaning ‘mountain
                of light’. Passing from one ruler to another by conquest and misadventure, the stone was finally presented
                to Queen Victoria following the annexation of the Punjab in 1849.
                You can view it in the Tower of London, which stands beside the Thames with 900 years of history as a
                Royal Palace, fortress, prison, and place of execution. For over 600 years, Kings and Queens of England
                have stored crowns and robes at the Tower of London. Since the 1600s, the coronation regalia itself,
                commonly known as the ‘Crown Jewels’ have been protected at the tower. An estimated 30 million people have
                seen them here, making them the most visited objects in Britain. Interestingly they are not just for show,
                but are actually used. At the annual Parliament’s State opening, the Queen wears the Imperial State Crown!
                St Edward’s Crown is the most important crown, which is made of solid gold and is only used at the time of
                the actual crowning. In 1911 (from the medieval crown originally thought to date back to the 11th-century
                saint-king Edward the Confessor), the solid gold was melted down and set with semi precious stones. It was
                first used for the coronation of George V.

                Buckingham Palace
              </h3>
              <p>Fancy having tea with the Queen? Everyone dreams of the impossible. But what you can see is to see the
                New Guard exchange duty with the Old Guard in the famous Changing the Guard ceremony outside the Palace.
                Also known as Guard Mounting, the daily ritual takes place outside the palace from 10.45am and lasts
                around 45 minutes, with the actual handover taking place at 11am. The Buckingham Palace Old Guard forms up
                in the palace’s forecourt from 10.30am and is joined by the St James’s Palace Old Guard at around 10.45am.
                The New Guard then arrives from Wellington Barracks and takes over the responsibilities of the Old Guard
                in a formal ceremony accompanied by music. </p>
              <p> The guard that looks after Buckingham Palace is called The Queen’s Guard and is made up of soldiers on
                active duty from the Household Division’s Foot Guards. The guards are dressed in traditional red tunics
                and bearskin hats. The ceremony is free to watch. There is no ceremony on days when large events are held
                in the city centre. Make sure to check the ceremony schedule on the Household Division’s website before
                your visit. </p>
              <p>Visit the official London residence of the Queen, as Buckingham Palace opens its doors to the public
                every summer. Every year, Buckingham Palace’s summer opening features special exhibitions. The year 2019
                marks 200 years since Queen Victoria’s birth so a special exhibition will tell the story of how the young
                queen transformed Buckingham Palace from a private house into a working royal residence. It is also the
                500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci’s death so another special exhibition in the palace will bring
                together more than 200 of the Renaissance master’s greatest drawings in the Royal Collection, forming the
                largest exhibition of Leonardo’s work in over 65 years. Explore the lavishly furnished State Rooms of one
                of the world’s few remaining working royal palaces, and look out for some of the Royal Collection’s
                greatest treasures on display.

                Hampton Court Palace
              </h3>
              <p>Set in 60 acres of beautiful riverside gardens, Hampton Court has been home to some of England’s greatest

                Tudor court. The fee includes the following free activities:

                their courtiers.
                Entrance to the Magic Garden, which your kids will just love. Come face-to-face with mysterious mythical

                palace’s past.</p>
              <p>Enter the world-famous MAZE, the UK’s oldest surviving hedge maze. Commissioned around 1700 by William
                III, it covers a third of an acre and is known for confusing and intriguing visitors with its many twists,
                turns and dead ends. On an average, it takes 20 minutes to reach the centre.</p>
              <p> Stroll through the Royal Courts, the Chapel Royal, the King’s Apartments or William III’s Private Study.

                Elizabeth II in the Renaissance Gallery, to the ‘modern’ Baroque façade designed by Sir Christopher Wren
                in the 1690s.

                Kensington Palace
              </h3>
              <p>If you are still entranced by the late, lamented Diana, Princess of Wales, you must visit The Kensington
                Palace. Catherine Walker created the signature look of the late Princess of Wales, and for the next 16
                years, she was to design stunning outfits for one of the world’s most photographed women. The display
                entitled Diana, Princess of Wales: Designs and Dresses by Catherine Walker offers an opportunity to see
                behind the scenes of a couturier’s workshop with drawings and outfits, many on-show for the first time.
              </p>
              <p> You can also visit the Kings State Apartments: The rooms are opulent, but sparsely furnished. Used only
                for audiences and meetings, so there was no need for lots of furniture, as the courtiers could not sit in
                the presence of royalty. But there are so many works of art and sculptures to be admired, like the
                terracotta busts of George II and his wife Queen Caroline, made by Michael Rysbrack in 1738 and 1739. </p>
              <p>The fireplace in the Presence Chamber is surrounded by limewood carvings including cherubs. In the Privy
                Chamber you can gaze at the magnificent ceiling, as well as the intricate tapestries. You can also view
                the distinctively Georgian age-influenced Cupola Room. Finally, the climax is the Kings Drawing Room, with
                its invaluable painting of Venus and Cupid by 16th Century Italian maestro painter Giorgio Vasari.
