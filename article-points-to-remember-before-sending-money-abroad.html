                Before you send the money it's important that you have the following details in hand about
                the person (beneficiary) you are sending money to and the payment you are wanting to make:
              </p>
              <ul class="simple_list">
                <li>Your account details
                </li>
                <li>Beneficiary's full name and address</li>
                <li>Beneficiary's bank code – normally the BIC (Bank Identifier Code)</li>
                <li>Beneficiary’s IBAN (International Bank Account number) or account number. An IBAN is a
                  series of letters and numbers that help identify accounts held anywhere in the world,
                  some beneficiaries may hold just an account number depending on their bank</li>

                information from your bank.</p>

            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">What exchange rate is used?
              </h3>
              <p>The exchange rate will change depending on the day and time your payment is made. It will
                also depend on the bank or company you use to send the money. Before completing the transfer
                your bank should be able to tell you about the exchange rate used. </p>
