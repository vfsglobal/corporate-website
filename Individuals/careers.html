            <p>“TALENT” is an HR initiative at VFS Global to ensure that our employees are in an environment that enables them to perform at the best of their abilities. The performance management system and succession planning model contribute significantly towards our objective of creating a constructive feedback mechanism that encourages continuous learning and identification of high potential performers.

Customer satisfaction indices, information security standards, application processing timings and error rates are some metrics which illustrate this alignment.</p>

We continuously monitor market trends and benchmarks to offer the best compensation to our employees. VFS Global’s total rewards pay special attention to the employee’s well-being.

            <p>As a trusted partner to our clients we ensure that we live the value of trust and integrity and our HR department strives in ensuring information security through following measures:</p>
            <ul class="simple_list">
              <li>No employee, irrespective of level or function, is allowed to join the organisation without detailed background verification.</li>
              <li>Senior positions at new locations are usually deputed from existing talent pool within the organisation.</li>

              <li>Regular employees are rotated within different operational and functional areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As custodians of organisation’s values and culture, our HR department sensitises our employees in handling confidential information that they would have access to during the course of their work. Employees are well aware that there is zero tolerance for any effort to influence decision on an application or for indulging in behaviours that breach our code of conduct.</p>

          <accordion-content>
            <p>Our success is based on the empowerment of our employees. It is our belief that an organisation can improve only by engaging its employees as strategic partners.  We have taken considerable amount of efforts to create career path with clear development opportunities for our employees.  Our learning and development programmes provide the competitive edge to our employees to catalyse our growth strategy.</p>
            <p>Genesis is our entry-level training programme through which an employee is inducted.  In addition, we have designed programmes focused on different aspects of customer service, such as basic and advanced communication skills, customer complaint handling ability and sales techniques. Our programmes based on team work, managerial skills, time management, ability to coach, and people management create a positive learning environment for all our employees. Customer orientation, supervisory skills and leadership programmes are conducted in all our regions and increasingly in local languages. While our Potential Development Centres, Supervisor Development Centres and Management Development Programmes equip our employees to take up roles of higher responsibilities, Advance Strategy training helps us develop leaders who have holistic view.</p>
            <p>Reaching out to our vast employee base, spread across the globe, is a challenge that VFS Global is tackling by leveraging technology. In an effort to address this, all our new programmes are being developed in an e-learning format to ensure a wider reach. We have, therefore, invested in an online “Learning Management System” to provide various modules across geographies at click of a button. This system is made available to all employees on their desktops and provides an effective tool through which the learning of each employee can be monitored.</p>
            <p>Apart from customised training programmes, we also offer external training programmes, such as PMP Certification, Six Sigma, Thomas Profiling by Thomas international, International Business Etiquette, etc.</p>
