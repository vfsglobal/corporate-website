                Why is Rome called the Eternal city? No other city in the world
                presents 2,500 years of architecture, art, music, food and wine
                like Rome does! Ancient Rome merges seamlessly into Rome of the
                Popes while holding a bond with the modern-day Rome. It’s a
                living, breathing museum. The traffic is chaotic, so metro
                transport is ideal, it delivers you effortlessly to all the
                spectacular sights spread out. Once you are in the open air,
                please walk. When you get tired, drink a cappuccino, gobble up a
                pizza slice, eat a gelato, or sip an aperitivo like Romans do.
              </p>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Day 1</h3>
              <p>
                Take the underground metro to the Colosseo station. As soon as
                you emerge out into the bright sunlight, your vision will be
                captivated by one of the greatest remaining monuments of ancient
                Rome. Originally called The Flavian Amphitheatre, it took nearly
                a 100 years and three emperors to build what the world gapes at
                with open mouth – the Colosseum. Amongst the thousands of
                statistics, let me give you just two to present the genius of
                its builders. First, this gigantic circle of stone was built on
                marshy ground after draining the lake. Second, the design of
                this free standing structure of stone, brick and marble (190
                metres in diameter) was to enable at least 60,000 excitable
                Romans to enter, find their seats, get entertained and finally
                leave by 80 exits without killing each other! For nearly 400
                years, citizens were entertained in what author Charles Dickens
                described as “the most impressive, most stately, grand,
                majestic, mournful sights.”
              </p>
              <p>
                You must go inside the Colosseo amphitheatre and climb up those
                ancient stairs. It was the first permanent amphitheatre to be
                raised in Rome and the most impressive arena the classical world
                had yet seen. Today, it’s the most visited monument in all of
                Italy!
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, walk back towards the Colosseo metro station, the starting
                point of a large avenue called Via Del Fori Imperiali. As you
                saunter along this Imperial Road, on your left are the ruins of
                the Foro Romani (Roman Forum), birthplace of ancient Rome around
                the 8th century BC. Now excavated and restored, here lie the
                landmark ruins of Temple of Vespasian and Temple of Saturn, the
                column of Phocas, Temple of Antonios and Faustina plus scores of
                columns. To see these glories of Roman Forum (Foro Romani) is to
                understand the larger-than-life attitude of the ancient Romans
                and how they inspired the grandiosity of hundreds of
                architectural marvels.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, in a straight line on the Via Imperiali, the Colosseum lies
                on the left, Foro Romani in the middle and on the right is the
                Capitoline Hill (the smallest of the seven hills of ancient
                Rome) crowned by Michaelangelo’s magnificient Campidoglio
                (Capitoline Museums Complex). Climb up the imposing cordonata
                staircase to the terrace from where you get an exceptional view
                of the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill, all of it dating back
                to 2500 years! Got an hour to spare? Visit the Capitoline
                Museum, which includes the world’s oldest public museum,
                displays artifacts (statuary, sarcophagi, jewellery) and has
                rooms teeming with ancient sculptures and mosaics.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re hungry after all this traipsing around, just head to
                the Terrace Café on top of the Capitoline Museum to dig into
                sandwiches and a beer and get rewarded with a 360-degree view of
                Rome! Two cafes here– Emmanuel’s Food and Terrazza Caffarelli,
                serve Italian fast food and Mediterranean cuisines. Tasty Pizzas
                and Salads are on offer at Vinando and Edoardo II, while
                Gelateria Vacanze’s Ice Creams are to die for. Yummy!
              </p>

                Day 2
              </h3>
              <p>
                More of ancient Rome’s must-see sights on the agenda. Alight at
                the Flaminio metro station and enter the vast beautiful square
                of Piazza del Popolo. About 300 years ago, it was the smart
                meeting place for evening carriage drives and carnivals. As you
                enter this vast Piazza, it’s impossible to miss the Church of
                Santa Maria del Popolo to your left. A peep inside reveals the
                fabled artist Caravaggio’s paintings of ‘Conversion of St. Paul’
                and ‘Crucifixion of St. Peter’. The main altar of the church is
                baroque and frames the famous Madonna. Next door to the church
                is the Leonardo da Vinci Museum, another must-visit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking across the beauty of the Piazza are the twin churches of
                S. Maria di Monte Santo and S. Maria de Miracoli. They straddle
                three main avenues - Via Ripetta, Via del Corso and Via del
                Babuino. Take the last one and within five minutes you arrive at
                the breath-taking Spanish Steps at Piazza di Spagna. Built in
                1726, this is the most-famous street staircase in the world! In
                front is the Barcaccia Fountain where all tourists first
                congregate and then climb the staircase which has three landings
                and thus is called Trinita dei Monti.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next? The Trevi Fountain. How to get there? Easy. Facing the
                Spanish Steps, turn right on the street called Via Del Traforo
                which meets up with Main Avenue called Via Del Corso. You will
                see the signs indicating where to head to arrive at Italy’s
                largest and most famous Baroque fountain. The centrepiece in the
                Trevi Fountain is the Greek Sea God Oceanus, accompanied by
                sea-horses and Tritons who are half men and half mermen.
                Factoid: An estimated 3,000 euros are thrown into the fountain
                each day!
              </p>
              <p>
                The Pantheon is a 10-minute walk from Trevi – it is the very
                essence of Rome, with its magnificent proportions still
                fascinating architects across the world! It was first built as a
                temple dedicated to all the gods of pagan Rome between A.D 118
                and 125.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine spending an entire evening, drinking wine, eating dinner
                whilst getting entertained by musicians, dancers, mime artists
                and even getting a portrait of yourself in the world’s most
                celebrated rectangle. Piazza Navona awaits your presence for an
                unforgettable evening. Adorned with fine Renaissance and Baroque
                buildings of the 16th Century, the breath-taking magnificence of
                the Piazza is enhanced by an Obelisk and not one but three
                fountains. At the Southern end, the Fountain of the Moor
                features an Ethiopian fighting with a dolphin. To the North, the
                Fountain of Neptune features sea figures playing in the basin,
                sea horses, cherubs, dolphins, and Nereids (sea nymphs). In the
                centre stands the glorious Fountain of the Four Rivers. The
                fountain consists of four figures, each representing a river:
                Nile, Ganges, Danube and Rio della Plata.

                Day 3
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here’s the link between the 2000-year-old ancient and
                500-year-old modern Rome. Both the Castel Sant’ Angelo and the
                St Peter’s Piazza of the Vatican are on the left side of the
                River Tiber that snakes through Rome. From the side of Piazza
                Narona, walk to the river where among many bridges, stands the
                Ponte Sant Angelo. The three central arches of the bridge are
                ancient remains of another bridge dating back to second century
                AD. With Bernini’s statues of angels, the Ponte St. Angelo leads
                you straight to another glory of ancient Rome - Castel Sant’
                Angelo.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under this 20-meter high massive circular edifice lies Hadrian’s
                Tomb. Once inside, take a look at the many rooms containing a
                collection of arms from the Bronze Age to modern times. Other
                rooms are former residences of various Popes and their internal
                decors with splendid frescoes and paintings. A narrow staircase
                will lead you to the terrace which gives you a splendid
                360-degree view of Rome.
              </p>
              <p>
                Avid tourists can take a walk on the splendid avenue called Via
                Della Conciliazone from CSA to the world famous St. Peter’s
                Basilica of the Vatican. The latter’s spectacular architecture
                arises like a surreal dream as you walk nearer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inside the vast circular Piazza surrounded by four files of
                column that soar sky high are also an Obelisk and two beautiful
                fountains. And there it is, the grand St Peter’s Basilica from
                whose upper terrace, popes have always delivered their sermons,
                speeches and blessings. Visitors are allowed to climb the
                stairway to Heaven for a considerable fee.

                Travel Tips
              </h3>
              <ul class="simple_list">
                <li>
                  Carry cash: Italy still largely functions as a cash economy,
                  so be sure to carry plenty with you. Coins are especially
                  welcome at cafés and small shops. Most stores and large
                  restaurants will process cards, but don’t traditionally split
                  the bill so cash is always useful, especially if you’re
                  travelling in a group.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tipping has not traditionally been part of the Italian
                  culture, as service charge is generally included in the bill,
                  but leaving a few extra coins at the table is often
                  appreciated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Drinking water! There are fountains everywhere you look. They
                  deliver free-flowing, potable water, so save your empty water
                  bottles and fill them up at these fountains.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Vegetarian? Look for the Contorni (side dish) section in the
                  menu, it features vegetables of the season.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rome’s public transportation is very good indeed. You can buy
                  bus/ metro tickets at any tabaccheria in the city, little
                  convenience stores that are designated with a large T. Tickets
                  are €1.50 each, or opt for a 24-hour, 48-hour or weekly
                  ticket.
