                Where Nature Embraces History
              </h3>
              <p>
                The city centre of Bratislava houses the Grassalkovich Palace, the residence of the Slovak President and
                the Bratislava Castle. The Gothic Church, St. Martin’s is a must visit as well. The only preserved gate of
                the city fortification system, Michael’s Gate provides an enchanting view of the castle and Old Town. You
                can find a bronze figure of a man peeking out of a manhole nearby. This statue famously called the
                ‘Rubberneck Cumil’ is the most photographed statue in the city.
              </p>
              <p>Since Bratislava lies at the banks of the Danube river apart from the Moltava, a cruise on the former is
                highly recommended. Since the river connects Vienna and Budapest, it is possible to traverse these cities
                as well. It is a city that celebrates art and culture as well. The Reduta Building houses the Slovak
                Philharmonic and if one gets a chance it is surely worth a visit. While walking through the city, memorial
                plaques inform us about the musical journey of the city. A six-year-old Mozart had performed at a concert
                on Ventúrska Street while Franz Liszt enthralled the audiences at the university Library. For a
                connoisseur of music, Bratislava is a wonderful place! </p>
              <p>An important medieval town in northeastern Slovakia, Bardejov is an archetypal example of medieval
                architecture in Central Europe. The city and its former Town Hall house an exposition of the Šariš Museum
                (Šarišské Múzeum) called “Bardejov – the Free Royal Town”. The Roman Catholic Basilica of St. Egidius is
                located at its northern section. The Franciscan Monastery with the Church stands out for its unique
                architecture.</p>
              <p>Eastern Slovakia is exceptionally beautiful and gifted with a number of natural sights. The Spis Castle
                is a visual delight. It is a quintessential example of a historical sight with rare natural beauty.
                Located above the town of Spisske Pohradie and the village of Zehra, it is a perfect destination for
                hikers and provides perfect views of the surrounding hills and valleys that decorate the landscape. The
                UNESCO Protected Spisska Kapitula is in close vicinity of the Spis Castle. Another place of exceptional
                natural beauty is the National Park in Tatra where dramatic views can capture your imagination. It is also
                home to some of the most endemic natural species in the world, including the Tatra Chamois.</p>

                Home of the Foodie
              </h3>
              <p>Food is an integral part of the Slovakian way of life. The lunch is the main meal of the day and the
                denné menu (Daily Menu) here consists of hot soup and the main meal. The traditional rich sauerkraut soup
                with pork and sausage is very unique. The cuisine here is a hearty amalgamation of Hungarian, Austrian,
                German and Slovak cultures. The Slovak Pub in Bratislava is an intriguing place to visit and its old
                fashioned atmosphere and homemade fare attract the visitor. The unique Observation Tower houses a
                celebrated restaurant and bar and is a landmark of Bratislava.</p>
              <p>While in the towns of Slovakia, you can try the local black currant and honey wines apart from the local
                coke Kofola, which is a nonalcoholic herbal fizzy drink meant to quench your thirst. The Tatra Tea, a
                concoction of everything ranging from tea to herbal liquor is also an attractive option. Similarly, the
                potato gnocchi dumplings with sheep cheese and bacon are a Slovakian specialty. Finally, you can savour
                the Bratislava rolls that include traditional pastries with poppy seeds and walnuts when you find the
                time. Slovakia is a city that is a perfect place to engage in revelry.
