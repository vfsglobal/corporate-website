              <p>If you’re preparing to fund your child’s degree and have several years in hand , you might want to consider <a href="https://internationalservices.hsbc.com/index/international-investment/" target="_blank">international investments</a>. However, while offering the potential for higher returns, an investment carries certain risks and you may end up with losses.</p>
