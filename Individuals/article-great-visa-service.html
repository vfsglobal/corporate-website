              <p>International travel is no longer a luxury restricted to families or businesses with deep pockets. A large percentage of travellers, irrespective of background, are increasingly keen to explore foreign destinations and embark on at least one overseas visit per year. With visa services offered for 58 countries worldwide, VFS Global prides itself on being a household name among avid travellers. </p>
              <p>VFS Global operates in 137 countries across the globe, and provides the same professional and best-in-class service at all its Visa Application Centres and Premium Lounges. Along with managing the visa process at the backend, VFS Global is focused on providing a world-class experience for travellers at its visa application centres, during the application process itself. </p>
              <p>The key to the success of any enterprise spread internationally is the system of standardisation. Walk into a Starbucks anywhere in the world, and the cafe, along with the coffee, will look the same. This is also especially true for VFS Global that is now embarking on a journey to further extend the scope of its services offered for travellers at all its centres worldwide. New or refurbished VFS Global Visa Application Centres and Premium Lounges across the world will have the same look and feel, ensuring applicants feel comfortable in a familiar environment, no matter which centre they visit.</p>
              <p>The first Visa Application Centres to feature VFS Global’s new standardised design are the Joint Visa Application Centre located in Mahalaxmi in Mumbai, India and the Application Centre for France in Algiers, Algeria. The Mumbai centre was launched in February 2018 with visa services for 20 countries on offer. The centre in Algiers is the second largest in the world for a single country and was opened in April 2018. The design will now be replicated at centres across the world in a phased manner during refurbishments</p>
