              <p>Follow these tips to enhance your visa application experience and make it more convenient and
                hassle-free.</p>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Be the early bird</h3>
              <p>When planning your travels, always book flights and hotels in advance. Do the same for visas. Most
                countries accept visa applications up to 90 days before your date of travel. So don’t wait until the last
                minute.</p>
              <p>If you need your visa in a hurry, you can opt for Priority Visa Service (available for select countries)
                for your visit, work or study application depending on the Mission/Embassy. This will put your application
                at the front of the queue at every stage of the decision-making process in an Embassy.
                For example, UK Visas and Immigration aims to make a decision on your Priority Visa application within
                five working days from when you submit your biometric information.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Check the turnaround times for processing</h3>
              <p>Each country has a different timeline for its visa processing, and these timelines are clearly mentioned
                on the country-specific websites (accessed via www.vfsglobal.com), providing you with the information
                required to apply for your visa well in advance. Be aware that during peak season visa processing can take
                longer than anticipated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Stay updated about visa status
              </h3>
              <p>Once your application is submitted, you can track its progress through VFS Global’s online tracking
                service. The status will be updated as and when your passport is ready for collection/delivery. Be aware
                that VFS Global cannot track your application during the assessment process within an Embassy or
                Consulate.</p>
              <p>For a stress-free experience, you can opt for the Assured Courier service to cover any loss or damage and
                receive guaranteed reimbursement* if your application is lost or damaged while in transit. This service is
                available at select Visa Application Centres.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Appointments
              </h3>
              <p>Some countries require applicants to schedule an appointment with the Visa Application Centre to submit an application. Once scheduled, we highly recommend being at the centre 15 minutes prior to the appointed time to avoid missing your slot.</p>
              <p>If you need to travel urgently, or have missed your pre-booked appointment, or simply cannot book an appointment at your preferred date and time, Prime Time Appointment service allows you to book an appointment outside the normal working hours. Many Visa Application Centres have extended operating hours during peak season to allow you to visit before work and after work.</p>
              <p>Once at the Visa Application Centre, the exclusive opening hours allow you to beat the queues and process your visa application with ease. Please check with the Visa Application Centre if this service is suitable for your visa application.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Making a list, checking it twice
              </h3>
              <p>A checklist of the documentation required for visa applications for each country served by VFS Global is available on our website. Be sure to carry all the requisite documentation to submit along with the duly filled application form. Check your passport’s validity. Many countries require a valid passport six months beyond your return date.</p>
              <p>UK visa applicants can also opt for the new Check and Verify service. With this service, you can run your documentation past trained VFS Global professionals for independent authentication and have the verification report sent directly to UKVI.</p>
              <p>This service helps you get a higher degree of assurance about the documents/information submitted while giving greater confidence to UKVI about the genuineness of the document.</p>
              <p>If you are facing issues with your visa application process, we are happy to help. Please drop us an email at <a href="mailto:customercare@vfsglobal.com">customercare@vfsglobal.com</a> and we will assist at the earliest. </p>
