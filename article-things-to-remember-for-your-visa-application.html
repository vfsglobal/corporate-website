              <p>Travel has become an integral part of our lives. Most families now take a holiday at least once a year, if not
                more; most working professionals travel on business, quite often involving international travel. This means
                everyone needs one very important piece of documentation—a visa. We do have some important tips to make your
                visa application experience simpler and more convenient. After all, who better than us? We do this every day!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Be the early bird</h3>
              <p>When planning your travels, always book flights and hotels in advance. Do the same for visas. Most countries
                accept visa applications up to 90 days before your date of travel. So don’t wait until the last minute.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Check the consulate/embassy website for turnaround time</h3>
              <p>Each country has a different timeline for its visa processing, and these timelines are clearly mentioned on their
                websites, providing you the information required to apply for your visa well in advance. Be aware that during
                peak season visa processing can take longer than anticipated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Stay updated about visa status</h3>
              <p>Once your application is submitted, you can track its progress through VFS Global’s online tracking service.
                The status will be updated as and when your passport is ready for collection/delivery. Be aware that VFS Global
                cannot track your application during the assessment process within an embassy or consulate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Appointments</h3>
              <p>Select countries require applicants to schedule an appointment with the Visa Application Centre to submit an
                application. Once scheduled, we highly recommend being at the centre 15 minutes prior the appointed time to
                avoid missing your slot.</p>
              <p>Please note: Embassies decide on number of available appointment slots.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Use VFS Global’s value-added services for a smooth process</h3>
              <p>VFS Global offers a range of additional services, designed to help you at every step of the visa application

            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Making a list, checking it twice</h3>
              <p>A checklist of the documentation required for visa applications for each country served by VFS Global is available
                on our website. Be sure to carry all the requisite documentation to submit along with the duly filled application
                form. Check your passport’s validity. Many countries require a valid passport six months beyond your return
                date.</p>
