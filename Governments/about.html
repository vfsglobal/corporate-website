                  <p>In a world of global migration, economic disparity, development and transitioning, Modern Slavery is a growing issue. Modern Slavery includes forced labour, debt bondage, human trafficking, descent-based slavery and child slavery. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), approximately 21 million people around the world are in slavery; this includes 5.5 million children.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                  <h4 class="padv_small"><strong>Commitment</strong></h4>
                  <p>VFS Global has a zero tolerance approach to Modern Slavery within its operations and supply chains and encourages its staff to report related concerns and incidents using the escalation matrix available across the organisation. The management is obligated to act on any raised concerns and held accountable for lack of action where necessary.</p>
                  <p>As on {{stats_ordinal_indicator_date}}, VFS Global has operations in {{stats.operation_countries}} countries, with {{stats.application_centres}} centres processing visas for {{stats.client_governments}} client governments, and is deeply committed against Modern Slavery in every one of its corporate offices and Visa Application Centres across the globe.</p>

                  <li>
                      <h4 class="padv_small"><strong>Implementation</strong></h4>
                      <p>VFS Global is committed to ensuring that all its employees are abreast of its zero tolerance approach to Modern Slavery and equipped to respond to any related situation that may arise.

The employees are encouraged to familiarise themselves with the policy, which is hosted on the organisation’s portal. For further clarifications, contact details of General Counsel and the Anti-Corruption Compliance Officer (ACCO) is made available.</p>
                      <p>Training and awareness sessions are designed to ensure complete understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in the supply chains and business. Train the Trainer programmes are designed to ensure the dissemination of accurate information to employees with regards to the policy. A training calendar will be planned for employees in a phased manner, spanning across the various regions/countries of operations starting with immediate effect and will continue until 31st March 2020.</p>
                      <p>Trainings will be imparted through various channels noted below:</p>
                      <p>Upon recruitment, new joining staff is required to undergo training on this policy as part of VFS Global’s induction programme. For existing employees, classroom style and virtual (via video call software Zoom) trainings, and eLearning modules (web based trainings) are available, followed by online assessments. eCertificates are awarded to staff upon successful completion of the training modules and assessment. Quizzes, case studies and awareness sessions will be planned periodically to ensure complete understanding and recall of the policy. The training sessions will be followed with regular audits by the Internal Audit as well as Corporate Security teams to ensure compliance to the policy across the organisation and supply chain.

                  <p>The Group’s vision is to be the market leader in the visa, consular and identity management
                    solutions industry. And our mission is to partner with governments to enable faster and informed
                    decision making in the area of consular and identity management services, by providing technology

                  <p>In the past 17 years the Group has developed highly differentiated solutions portfolio including
                    dedicated visa and passport application centres, information services (contact centres), web based
                    modules (for appointment scheduling and online payment collection), biometrics solutions

                  <p>It is a well acknowledged fact that this industry plays a very direct and strong role in global

                  <h4 class="padv_small"><strong>Approach to risk management and governance arrangements</strong></h4>
                  <p>As a Group, we are deeply committed to ethical business practices (as highlighted in our Corporate
                    Social responsibility and Code of Conduct policies) and to respecting local laws in the territories
                    where we operate, and this has a direct bearing on our approach to taxation. We are committed to
                    compliance with the tax laws and practices in the countries in which we operate and have
                    implemented robust governance processes to enable us to do so.</p>
                  <p>Our tax function is involved in structuring business arrangements, agreements, restructuring
                    projects and acquisitions conducted by the Group. Consequently, all tax risks are identified and
                    considered before concluding on such business decisions. The tax function also reviews and advises
                    the wider group on all key agreements and arrangements, specifically cross-border transactions, and
                    their input is mandatory as an internal policy prior to the final sign off on these agreements /
                    arrangements from the Legal Team.</p>
                  <p>Based on pre-determined guidelines, escalation mechanisms are in place within the group with
                    respect to key tax matters / risks including reporting to the Chief Financial Officer or Chief
                    Executive Officer of the Group or the Audit Committee or the Board, as required.</p>

                <li>
                  <h4 class="padv_small"><strong>Attitude towards tax planning</strong></h4>
                  <p>Tax planning is only considered where there is a commercial rationale and is carried out within
                    the parameters of the legal and tax frameworks set out by the jurisdictions in which we operate.
                  </p>
                  <p>All tax decisions are made in response to commercial activity and tax is just one of many factors
                    taken into consideration when making such decisions. Any tax planning that is undertaken is
                    reviewed yearly, along with the Group’s tax strategy, as part of the annual Audit Committee
                    meeting. </p>
                  <p>We endeavour to use automated technology to track tax related compliances in various operating
                    jurisdictions and also modify/alter/create technology used in operations for easy and accurate
                    implementation of tax reforms, wherever possible. </p>

                  <h4 class="padv_small"><strong>Approach towards dealings with tax authorities</strong></h4>
                  <p>The Group has always maintained a cooperative and collaborative relationship with tax authorities
                    and will continue to do so. In territories such as the UK, where we have an allocated Customer
                    Relationship Manager, we hold face to face meetings to discuss our tax affairs, and we pro-actively
                    engage with tax authorities wherever required.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4 class="padv_small"><strong>Level of risk in relation to tax that the group is prepared to accept</strong></h4>
                  <p>We have a minimal tax risk tolerance as a Group. We are committed to compliance with the tax laws
                    and practices in all of the countries in which we operate, and continuously monitor changes to tax
                    legislation, ensuring that we take advice where appropriate from professional advisers. </p>
                  <p>Given the nature of our business and geographic footprint, it is inevitable that risks may arise
                    with respect to the application of tax laws that are complex and uncertain at times. The level of
                    tax risk that we accept is driven by our overarching values, corporate social responsibility, brand
                    and reputation. We routinely seek professional advice where the application of tax laws to a
                    material transaction or a given situation is reasonably unclear or uncertain, or where specialist
                    knowledge is required, particularly in relation to international tax matters.</p>
                  <p>The Group’s Internal Audit function is responsible for reviewing the relevant processes and
                    controls which are in place for tax, with oversight provided by the Audit Committee, who reviews
                    the controls in place for tax compliances on a quarterly basis.</p>
