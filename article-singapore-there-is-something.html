                Travellers go to Singapore for the retail therapy of course, but
                also for the food, the sights and the luxe hotels. Here is a
                snapshot of what Singapore has to offer:
              </p>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Singapore Zoo</h3>
              <p>
                It’s the world’s best rainforest zoo, with eclectic sections
                like the Fragile Forest, the human-like Orangutans (who can be
                your breakfast companions) and the Polar Bear habitat. Meet
                proboscis monkeys, Asian elephants, pygmy hippos, sun bears and
                the adorable pandas—Kai Kai and Jia Jia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without leaving the general area, go on a River Safari, which is
                also a part of Wildlife Reserves (and sister attraction to the
                Zoo and Night Safari). Check out aquatic creatures that inhabit
                different water body environments—from the world’s largest
                puffer fish in the Congo to giant salamanders in the Yangtze.
                Get wet in a boat journey on the Amazon River Quest, which takes
                you through the rainforest so cleverly recreated. Want more?
              </p>
              <p>
                Then do the night safari! All aboard the tram that rolls through
                habitats where you can get on and get off at designated stops to
                marvel at nocturnal animals and what they get up to, when the
                rest of the world is sleeping! Do not forget to catch the
                beautifully choreographed creatures of the night theatre show.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Singapore Flyer</h3>
              <p>
                Reams have been written about this giant wheel. Tourists rave
                about it to their friends. The Singapore Flyer ride is a
                must-do. I went one step further. I tried out the world’s first
                Full-Butler dining experience in the skies. French bubbly
                accompanied the appetising entrees of scallops and other
                seafood.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next round when our cabin came to Ground Zero, the butlers
                brought in Chicken Sea Bass topped with XO sauce and roast Duck
                comfit. The cost of dinner for two is $352. My verdict? A
                memorable dinner, because on this spinning wheel, you get
                priority boarding, a choice of four course
                Western/Chinese/Vegetarian menu and in one hour you get two
                rotations! The 7 pm experience is better than the later one,
                since you get to see most of Singapore in the evening that
                softly escapes into twilight.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Jurong Bird Park</h3>
              <p>
                It’s impossible to ever forget the King of the Skies show, daily
                put on twice here. Birds of prey like eagles, hawks and falcons
                soar in the skies and on invisible commands swoop down in flying
                loops.
              </p>
              <p>
                What is Falconry? A simulated hunt with accompanying commentary
                reveals all. It’s as unforgettable as the High Flyers show,
                which features the largest number of performing birds in a
                single creatively choreographed act! Asia’s (perhaps the
                world’s) biggest bird park is home to over 5,000 magnificent
                birds across 400 species and also has a free-flying aviary that
                is spread across twenty hectares.
              </p>
              <p>
                Too far to walk? The Hop-on-Hop-off tram ride helps you discover
                the feathered friends at your own pace. Explore the kingdom of
                penguins and meet birds like cassowary and the emu, that are
                actually descendants of the dinosaurs.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Sentosa</h3>
              <p>
                Ten years ago, Sentosa was known as the suburban outpost of
                Singapore. Now it’s called the Ministry of Fun! The Sentosa Line
                cable car connects all of the island’s multiple attractions.
                Private beach clubs, welcoming golf courses, a yachting marina
                and at least 20 deluxe hotels offer comfortable stays to explore
                the likes of Adventure Cove Park, Insect Kingdom, Butterfly
                Park, Aquarium, Madame Tussauds, etc. And then, there is
                Universal Studios! It’s got seven themed zones—Hollywood, New
                York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away
                and Madagascar. There are daily parades, nightly fireworks, and
                it gets so very crowded on weekends.
              </p>
              <p>
                Get an Express Pass to skip the line and get on to the world’s
                most adrenaline pumping roller coaster ride where you are upside
                down all the time. Gulp!
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s expensive to take the cable car into Sentosa but it’s the
                most fun. Start from Mount Faber station and fly through the air
                for a spectacular view of Singapore, the harbour and its docks
                as you arrive at Sentosa.
              </p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Nightlife</h3>
              <p>
                Still rocking till the wee hours of the morning, there’s no
                moral police here. Just tourists and locals alike letting their
                hair down and getting spirits up. My favourite still is Long Bar
                where the Singapore Sling is supposed to have originated. Its
                elegant Raffles Hotel location with 1920s Malayan plantations
                ambience brings a smile to my soul. No visit to Singapore is
                complete without a late night out at Harry’s Bar on 28 Boat
                Quay. Live bands and the river flowing gently by make the bar so
                every special.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are so many rooftop bars offering a diversity of
                experiences. Here are some of the best:
              </p>
              <p>
                Beers that make you say cheers! LeVel 33 is the highest
                microbrewery in the world, situated on the top floor of Marina
                Bay Financial Centre Tower One. They serve an amazing range of
                creatively crafted house beers, from dark stouts to light ales.
                To make the experience complete, dig into their pub
                grub—gnocchi, steaks, cod fish, seafood.
              </p>
              <p>
                Want to get higher? Like 63 floors high? 1-Altitude at the top
                of One Raffle Place is hip, hot, happening over three different
                levels and numerous bars. On weekend nights, the dance floor is
                packed with movers and shakers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another one just like it, is Ce La Vi, nestled on top of the
                Marina Bay Sands complex.You don’t have to pay to enter this
                chillout lounge, poolside terrace and restaurant, but drinks
                start at $S20. Not bad considering the view with a whew!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Food and more food!</h3>
              <p>
                Chinese, Malay, Indian, Singaporean… there is no end to the food
                scene. There’s a cuisine for every taste and budget! Street food
                is safe, very easy on the pocket and a melting pot of
                Singapore’s diverse cultures. Go to Maxwell Food Centre and
                gobble up goodies like Tian Tian Chicken Rice. Missing Indian
                food? Biryanis, dals, dosa restos abound at Quartier Little
                India. More hawker fare (Korean, Filipino, Japanese) awaits you
                at Lau Pa Sat in the Central Business District. Last but not the
                least, Satay Street, parallel to Lau Pa Sat serves finger
                licking satay skewers. Yum!
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are into gourmet food, you can splurge at so many
                celebrity chef restaurants. Jade restaurant at the Fullerton
                Hotel serves sublime Cantonese cuisine: Peking duck, lobster,
                crispy pork belly and sauteed scallops. They even offer a dim
                sum set lunch at S$ 58 per person. Ever eaten fried carrot cake
                with XO sauce? Taste Paradise may be a kitsch name, but this
                fine dining restaurant located in Ion Orchard serves up
                mouth-watering dishes like Classic Shark’s Fin in Supreme Broth,
                Crisp-fried Tofu in Black Truffle Sauce, Pan-seared Foie Gras
                with Peking Duck Reduction and many more.

            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Massages</h3>
              <p>
                All that sightseeing and shopping deserves a reward. What better
                than a massage?
              </p>
              <p>
                At the Lush Spa, voted as Singapore’s top spa and located inside
                the Singapore Polo Club, two masseuses took turns de-kinking my
                tired muscles. One pampered my head and shoulders. The other
                performed an extremely professional reflexology on the soles of
                my feet. 90 minutes later, I was a new bionic man! On the final
                day before catching my flight out I got another reflexology
                treatment at Spa Nes, which is open 24x7! Located on the second
                level of Furama Riverfront Hotel, this mega spa club has it all—
                thermal pools, cryo pools, dining cove and dedicated rooms for
                Thai massages and foot reflexology. Keeps the jet lag away!

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">ISLAND HOPPING</h3>
              <p>
                Did you know that Singapore is one of the only three city states
                in the world? The other two are Monaco and Vatican city. Did you
                know that Singapore is not one island, but sixty? Yessir! Most
                are uninhabited but some of them, such as Pulau Ubin, can be
                visited for day trips or overnight stays. Pulau Ubin is a short
                ride from Changi Village on the east coast of Singapore proper,
                and has walking trails and is popular with those wanting to know
                how Singapore looked many years ago. Other islands include Ghost
                Island, Junk Island (made from landfill) and Frog Island.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">MARINA BAY SANDS</h3>
              <p>
                The world’s most strikingly designed hotel is a tourist
                destination unto itself. For foodies, it offers the world’s
                finest collection of restaurants under one roof, most of them
                run by celebrity chefs. For those who flirt with Lady Luck,
                there is the world’s most expensive standalone Casino!
              </p>
              <p>
                Since it opened, the world’s largest atrium casino with 500
                tables and 1,600 slot machines has amply contributed to the
                bottom line profitability. The resort includes a 2,561-room
                hotel, a 1,300,000 sq ft convention-exhibition centre, 800,000
                sq ft area of The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands mall (shop till
                you drop), a museum, two large theatres, two floating crystal
                pavilions and art-science exhibits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The icing on the cake is the world’s longest elevated swimming
                pool on the 57th Floor. Imagine swimming in an infinity pool
                that offers an aerial view of all of Singapore spread out below!

Shoppers with impossibly slim physiques trot on equally impossibly high heels carrying giant bsized bags full of goodies!

Orchard Road is as famous as Champs Elysees, but the Parisian competitor does not have underground pedestrian walkways that connect over 22 shopping malls and six department stores! Shop all day, but no sweat because you never have to leave the air-conditioning. Singapore’s town planners make it easy for private enterprises to thrive by ensuring tourists come back again and again."
