              <p>
                Did you know cravats originated in Croatia? I didn’t either;
                till perchance I stumbled inside the Oktogon passageway, lined
                with shopping temptations. Croats take immense pride for having
                invented a type of necktie of which Croata is the most famous
                brand exported worldwide. Inside Oktogon I also chanced upon
                ‘Hats by Kobali’, opened in 1974 and now another European
                favourite in Monte Carlo, Paris and London. “Every single hat
                tells a story – it looks for a head and is beautiful only if it
                finds one,” says the famous milliner who represents the fourth
                generation of hatmakers in her family.

                The Cathedral
              </h3>
              <p>
                Sing Ave Maria! At the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Holy
                Virgin Mary. In the front courtyard, the Holy Virgin Mary’s
                golden statue is perched on a high column with four gilded
                angels at the base. The Cathedral itself is the tallest and most
                monumental Neo-Gothic style sacral building in the entire
                southern Alps region! In this historic setting, the cathedral’s
                two elegant bell towers can be seen from a radius of ten
                kilometres away. Severely damaged in an 1880 earthquake, the
                cathedral’s restoration stands testimony to the robust health of
                Croatia’s Catholic faith. The Treasury here contains priceless
                works of religious art and objects on display.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Stone Gate</h3>
              <p>
                A 10-minute walk away from the Cathedral, on ancient
                cobblestoned streets, meander gently up a hill through a Stone
                Gate to a painting of the Holy Mother Mary and infant Jesus.
                Pray. Make a wish. This Chapel was built to commemorate the
                survival of these medieval walls. On its 200th anniversary, this
                Stone Gate and open-air Chapel were officially declared a
                pilgrimage site.

              <p>
                The sense of having stepped back in time at least 500 years
                continues with the sight of a sign which indicates it to be
                Europe’s second-oldest pharmacy. It still sells ancient potions
                and herbs. I almost imagine toothless grinning witches going
                bubble, bubble, toil and trouble! Ten steps ahead, your hard
                climb is rewarded by yet another visual delight. St Mark’s
                Church stands as a iconic monument, covered with a roof of
                ceramic glazed tiles that glisten brightly in the Sun and can be
                seen sparkling colorfully from miles away.

                Mending Broken Hearts
              </h3>
              <p>
                For such a small city, Zagreb has many museums. Some of them
                very quirky. From great artists and sports stars to illusions
                and torture chambers, there’s a museum for every swank or spank.
                Check out the most innovative European Museum winner– Museum of
                Broken Relationships. Packed with tourists from across the
                world, I saw nubile nymphets from Japan with tears in their
                eyes, young besotted couples sighing away while I was sorely
                tempted to ROFL. From matchboxes to wedding gowns, from high
                heeled shoes to anguished letters, from a pharmaceutical bowl(!)
                to an axe that was used to destroy an ex-lover’s furniture one
                day at a time(!!), this Museum is a collection of material
                objects that signify the death of a relationship and ergo,
                broken hearts.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Pizzas by the slice. Corn cobs sold steamingly sizzled by street
                vendors. Big Burgers at Rouge Maria restaurant situated inside
                an ex-light bulb factory! The Basement wine bar where over 90
                Croatian wines are served by the glass, accompanied by a super
                selection of Croatian cheeses. Sweet tooth? VINCEK is a Zagreb
                institution, jam-packed night and day. We pigged out on almond
                and dense dark chocolate, nougat and pistachio ice creams, and
                organic tea.

                24 X 7 Party Zone
              </h3>
              <p>
                Our new friend Tihana describes Zagreb as “Europe’s largest
                open-air, 24x7 feel good zone”. Misplaced pride or hyperbole?
                Tkalciceva (pronounced Kalchi cheva) street validates her claim.
                Over 200 years ago, a bubbling brook powered the city’s thriving
                floor mills in this area. Then came the paper, liqueur and
                leather factories, their effluents turning the pristine waters
                poisonous. In 1910, the city fathers diverted the stream and
                built a cobblestone street. Scores of pubs, bars, cafes and
                restaurants opened . Feeding tourists from richer European
                cities. Now it’s a vibey, trancey avenue crowded by shiny happy
                people (think drunk!) quaffing barrels of beer and magnums of
                vodka, while watching the world walk by. Champs Elysees it is
                not. Friendly, fun, foodie it is. Mostly great value-for-money.

Zagreb’s dominant architecture is that of gorgeous 18th and 19th Century Austro-Hungarian influence. And so, by day, whilst walking around, there is a sense of having stepped back a few centuries and you expect characters out of a Pushkin or Tolstoy novel to step out! But hey, here’s the surprise. Zagreb has a reputation of being called ‘Europe’s largest open-air, 24x7 feel-good zone’ with scores of pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants open almost 24 hours, packed with shiny happy people quaffing barrels of beer and vats of vodka."
