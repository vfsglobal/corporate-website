              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Gauja National Park</h3>
              <p>Established in 1973, the Gauja National Park stretches over more than 90,000 hectares, protecting the most beautiful section of the Gauja Valley that lies along the Gauja river and between the towns of Valmiera and Murjani. The largest and oldest of the national parks in Latvia, the park’s major attractions include magnificent sandstone outcrops, rocks, high cliffs and caves.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Alberta Iela</h3>
              <p>Often regarded as Riga’s Gem, Alberta Street is full of splendid, historical Art Nouveau-style buildings, of which eight are now recognised as architectural monuments of national significance. Constructed within a short span of time between 1901 and 1908, each of the buildings is decorated with figure sculptures, façades with protruding balconies, columns and other elements of Art Nouveau. </p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Kuldiga</h3>
              <p>Also called the Venice of Latvia, Kuldiga became an important economic, administrative and cultural centre of the Duchy of Courland in the 17th century. Granted the European heritage label in 2008, the historical buildings of the town along with its unique character, create a harmonious ensemble. While visiting, you can take the Goldingen train ride through the Old Town to see the Saint Catherine’s Church. Another highlight of the town is the Alekšupite Waterfall. The highest in Latvia (4.5 m high), it was built on the Alekšupite river and was used to operate the first paper mill in Kurzeme.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Ancient Castles</h3>
              <p>While Latvia is home to over 100 castles, of all sizes, a few of them are known globally simply for their sheer grandness and historical importance. However, the smaller ones too deserve a visit for their medieval ambience and legends. A large number of these castles are now in ruin, but a few of them, such as Turaida Castle, Cesis Castle, and Bauska Castle still stand, and can even be toured. For example, the Turaida Castle is an outstanding example of Medieval architecture from 1214 and the Cesvaine Palace has been included in the list of European cultural heritage. There are museums in many castles that inform visitors about the culture and life of the Middle Ages. </p>

Set amidst the fertile Zemgale Plains in South Latvia, the Rundale Palace and Museum works as a centre for research into Latvia’s history, through creating collections, arranging exhibitions and producing publications. Displays in the exhibition halls include applied art, fine art and historical expositions.
