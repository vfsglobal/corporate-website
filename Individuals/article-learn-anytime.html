            Knowledge is like the proverbial elephant; each learner approaches
            it in a different way. Learning has evolved beyond the classroom,
            and tech legends such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg
            (and several other dropout-millionaires) show that there’s more than
            a single way to learn. Whether you were a star pupil or always at
            the back of the class, teaching theory now looks to recognise each
            person for what they are worth – each a “different kind of learner”
            with a different set of talents and a different method of
            articulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping pace with this evolving view of teaching and learning, VFS
            Global Edu Support Services Pvt. Ltd. has launched ‘VFS-Oxademy’, a
            new digital learning platform in partnership with UK-based Edtech
            Oxademy Technologies and its subsidiary, the Oxademy Business
            School.
          </p>
          <p>
            The online-guided learning platform, a first-of-its-kind worldwide,
            currently offers PG and Executive Education Programmes in four
            fields of business administration and leadership studies. The
            courses offered are:
          </p>
          <ul class="simple_list">
            <li>MBA: Master of Business Administration</li>
            <li>MSL: Masters in Strategic Leadership</li>
            <li>MSOL: Masters of Science in Organisational Leadership</li>
            <li>
              GLDP: Global Leadership Development Programme (4-6 months
              professional certificate programme)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The study programmes are designed in partnership with distinguished
            US and UK-based universities and institutions, and include classes
            and lectures by top-rated faculty members and guest speakers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The unique feature of VFS-Oxademy’s online modules is that it uses
            OX360, the award-winning Artificial Intelligence (AI) cloud
            infrastructure/technology that is sensitive to the specific
            behaviour and learning patterns of each individual learner.
            According to the personalised learning pathway rolled out for the
            individual learner, he/she can finish the degree course in a period
            of 16, 24 or 36 months.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an added benefit, the OX360 Mobile App also facilitates students
            to learn the concepts included in their curricula in convenient,
            bite-sized portions. It also enables students to receive alerts
            about upcoming study topics and to connect with their course tutors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Busy executives wishing to advance their job prospects by bettering
            their educational qualification can conveniently log on to the
            VFS-Oxademy study programmes after office hours and earn their
            degrees in due course, all without taking leave from work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The entry requirements for enroling for the study programmes
            include:
          </p>
          <ul class="simple_list" type="1">
            <li>
              A minimum of a lower second-class honours degree or equivalent
              qualification
            </li>
            <li>
              A minimum of two years relevant work experience, which includes
              managerial responsibility (work experience is a must for MBA)
            </li>
            <li>English proficiency test (IELTS 6 or equivalent)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The programmes are delivered either in a fully online mode or as a
            mix of virtual learning and real-world classroom-learning. In tandem
            with the programmes, there is always a real-time analysis of a
            learner’s performance aswell.
          </p>
          <p>
            These heavyweight, accredited VFS-Oxademy degrees are on par with
            and identical to on-campus courses, but are lighter on the pocket as
            they cost significantly less than a traditional course.
            Nevertheless, students benefit from all the tools and facilities
            that are accessible to on-campus students.
          </p>
          <p>
            VFS-Oxademy students also have access to the world’s largest digital
            library (containing more than 1 million ebooks) as well as an
            internationally-recognised platform for publishing their business
            research projects. They can additionally benefit from the prospect
            of working on real-world projects with an Oxademy Industry Partner
            (OIP).
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon completion of the course, students can attend their graduation
            ceremony in the UK or USA.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who have enrolled for the Master of Science Programme in
