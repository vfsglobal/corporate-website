                  Yas Island is growing in popularity as a one-of-its-kind
                  leisure and entertainment hub for travellers visiting the UAE.
                  What kind of growth have you seen in the past year?
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Year-on-year, we continue to welcome leisure travellers from
                across the globe who come to Yas Island in search of a
                destination like nowhere else. Last year alone, 27 million
                visitors enjoyed the Island’s unrivalled line-up of world-class
                leisure and entertainment experiences, and this undoubtedly has
                a marked effect on Abu Dhabi’s tourist numbers which reported a
                rise of 4.9% in the first five months of 2018 (according to the
                Department of Culture and Tourism Abu Dhabi). Yas Island has
                long been favoured by South Asian travellers and only continues
                to grow in terms of popularity, as is evident by a significant
                increase in Indianvisitation to our theme parks this year.
