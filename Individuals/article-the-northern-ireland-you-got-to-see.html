                Castle Ward
              </h3>
              <p>
                Let’s begin with where it all started. Since the 16th century, the Ward family has called Castle Ward their home. But in the Seven Kingdoms, this sprawling property has another name – Winterfell, the ancestral home of House Stark. Here, you can practice archery in the same spot as Jon Snow, model some authentic Westeros attire and feast on a lavish medieval banquet inspired by the show.

              </h3>
              <p>Guesthouse and marvel at the Game of Thrones-inspired door, depicting scenes from the sixth season of the series. These intricate masterpieces dot the landscape of Northern Ireland and were carved out of the wood of the 200-year-old beech trees at the Dark Hedges.

                Tollymore Forest Park
              </h3>
              <p>Step in to the woods and walk the paths of the White Walkers tread, through magnificent red woods and centuries-old stone structures. Known as the Haunted Forest in Westeros, this expanse of wild woodland is where we first came face-to-face with the cold-blooded creatures. It’s also where the Starks encountered their new-born direwolves for the first time. Seek out treasures on your own in the mossy glow of these ancient trees – but be on the lookout for any blue eyes watching you from the gloom.

                Shillanavogy Valley
              </h3>
              <p>Beneath Slemish Mountain, where St. Patrick once served as a shepherd, lies the Shillanavogy Valley. But this peaceful land is home to some rowdier residents in Essos – in the show, this is the setting for the Dothraki Sea. Khal Drogo rode across this land towards Vaes Dothrak with his new bride, Daenerys Targaryen, and her wicked brother Viserys.

                The Dark Hedges
              </h3>
              <p>Can you imagine anything more terrifying than fleeing from the Lannisters? But that’s just what Arya Stark did, as she escaped down the Kingsroad alongside the Night’s Watch. The Dark Hedges provides a superb backdrop for Arya’s flight – the beech trees, with their twisting trunks and rustling canopy far above, are over 200 years old. Walk this legendary road and transport yourself to the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
              <p>At the very end of the Dark Hedges lies Gracehill House – call in for dinner and a drink, and see another of the Game of Thrones doors, commemorating Bran’s transformation into the Three-Eyed Raven.</p>

                Inch Abbey
              </h3>
              <p>Inch Abbey has quite a history – not only is it a beautiful Cistercian Abbey founded in 1180, but it’s also where the War of the Five Kings began. The houses of the North took up the cry of “the King in the North!”, after learning of Ned Stark’s death, spurring his son Robb on to war. On a clear day, while you sit beside the gushing River Quoile, you can see Downpatrick Cathedral, where St Patrick is said to be buried.
