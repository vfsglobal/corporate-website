          <p>VFS Global in Russia and CIS countries has joined hands with the international Dadobro voluntary movement in order to foster a socially-oriented corporate culture among its employees.</p>
          <p>The movement brings
            together more than 20
            companies from around
            the world. It has 2500 volunteers spread across
            50 cities in eight countries, namely Russia, UK,
            Finland, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine
            and Uzbekistan.</p>
          <p>Dadobro (joining two Russian words ‘Da’
            meaning Yes and ‘Dobro’ meaning Good) acts
            as a bridge between needy people and the
            corporates. Employees of those companies that
            have joined the movement can volunteer for
            humanitarian initiatives organized in their cities.
            In a year, the movement organizes about 800
            initiatives based on their worldview of doing
            good to the planet and for all those living on it.</p>
          <p>The main Dadobro initiatives lie in the area
            of providing help to orphanages and hospitals,
            donating blood, taking care of veterans and
            nursing homes, running environment protection
            initiatives, helping with animal shelters, etc.</p>
          <p>Apart from strengthening the core essence of
            humanity in the employees, the Dadobro events
            provide a good platform for corporate team
            building. Besides, as a company, VFS Global has
            always prioritized its growth as a sustainable
            business that gives back to society in whatever
            way it can to make the world a better, kinder
            place to live in.</p>
          <p>Say “Da!” and let’s together make this world a
            positive place.</p>
