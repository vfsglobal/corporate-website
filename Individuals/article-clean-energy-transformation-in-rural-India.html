              <p><strong>Vidya Sagar Devabhaktuni, Founder and President of SKG Sangha, a partner of Swiss NGO myclimate, speaks about the transformative power of biogas projects in rural India, highlighting VFS Global’s contribution to them. With global focus on reliable and long-lasting renewable energy solutions, environmental NGO SKG Sangha has been making great strides in bringing low-carbon clean energy to villages across India.</strong></p>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Tell us a little about the biogas plant in Kolar, Karnataka, that has been operationalised in partnership with VFS Global. </h3>
              <p>
                Biogas plant is an anaerobic digester that produces biogas (combination of methane and carbon-dioxide) by fermenting organic matter with the help of the natural bacteria.
              </p>
              <p>As part of the Kolar biogas project, a biogas plant is installed in each household in Kolar – this is a fixed dome model biogas plant that produce biogas through animal dung, which is available with the household. The generated biogas is burnt in a biogas burner that replaces a traditional wood fuel cook stove. Using this burner also removes indoor air pollution and creates a clean cooking environment. </p>
              <p>The spent slurry from the plant is useful in speeding up the fermentation process of other organic waste matter and be used in agricultural lands, increasing the soil fertility and replacing part of chemical fertilisers used for soil nutrition. </p>
              <p>Overall, the biogas plant becomes sustainable as the animals (dairy and agricultural beasts) are also part of the rural settlement system. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">What impact has this plant made to the community around it? Has it changed the community’s dependence on LPG? </h3>
              <p>
                Each biogas plant replaces LPG and kerosene and saves about seven tons of CO2-equivalent of Green House Gases (GHGs) per year, and also saves some 4.5 tons of fuel wood and 85 kg of chemical fertiliser per year. It also saves about 20 acres of forest in its lifetime thus helping the entire ecosystem. The manure does not emit GHGs as it is treated in an anaerobic digester and also avoids proliferation of mosquitoes.
              </p>
              <p><strong>The sustainable benefits to the households using it are multifold:</strong></p>
              <ul class="simple_list">
                <li>Efficient cooking stoves fired with clean biogas fuel reduces indoor air pollution and respiratory problems currently caused by smoke from inefficient cook stoves burning fuel wood. </li>
                <li>The installation of a biogas unit will reduce the consumption of fuel wood and therefore reduce the pressure on scarce forest resources, increasing bio-diversity. </li>
                <li>Women and children can use time otherwise required for collecting fuel wood, setting a fire and getting it going, for education and generating income. </li>
                <li>Cleaning of the kitchen and pots is easier as biogas is a clean fuel and does not emit the levels of soot and other particulate matter produced by burning fuel wood. </li>
                <li>The slurry produced from the biogas units is a valuable organic fertiliser that can be applied directly to the fields or composted with other organic material to improve crop yields and reduce the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. </li>
                <li>Saves foreign currency as the alternative fuels, like kerosene and LPG, and chemical fertilisers are imported. </li>
                <li>Creates rural employment during setup and maintenance. </li>
                <li>Reduces green house gas emissions and prevents global warming. </li>
                <li>Cost savings for households in the form of reduced fire wood, kerosene, LPG, chemical fertilisers and pesticides purchases.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">
                How many villages/families have been impacted – what are the cost savings for each family and each village?
              </h3>
              <p>
                About 8,000 rural families are covered under this project. If we take five persons per family, we can say around 40,000 people are benefited. The savings from not purchasing chemical fertiliser, kerosene, fuel wood and LPG amounts to about
                `2,500 per year.</p>
              <p>Direct savings by the project unit will be
                `25,000 in the project life time of 10 years. Each unit costs about `7,000 to the beneficiary and the remaining cost of `23,000 is borne through the proceeds of CER sales. Apart from this, the project is spending about `7,000 for 10 years’ maintenance and this amount is also covered through emission offset revenues.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">What kind of reactions/interest has this project generated from stakeholders / observers / other town / cities in India?</h3>
              <p>The villages using this model now have a sustainable cooking energy at no cost, and are seeing the improved sanitation. People in the neighbouring non-project villages and areas are also asking for biogas plants. Because of the avoidance of indoor air pollution, the health of women and children has improved. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">How can such projects remain sustainable, and lead to self sufficiency within a community (without external funding)?</h3>
              <p>It is highly difficult to implement the project without financial help from an outside source as the unit installation and maintenance costs are beyond the reach of the villagers. It would take about 15 years to get back the investment. Either government assistance or higher than the market CER price are the other alternatives for the project implementation. Here we have to consider the cumulative positive effects of biogas units on climate change. </p>
