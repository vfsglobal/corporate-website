                The flip side to this dream for several gullible youngsters and
                job-seekers in India, though, remains the threat of fraud. Over
                the last year, VFS Global has continually faced the issue of
                scammers posing as employees or associates of the organisation
                and embezzling innocent applicants.
              </p>
              <p>
                Misusing VFS Global’s trusted name in the visa space, such
                scammers lure unsuspecting aspirants with the false promise of
                overseas settlement. An all-too-frequent modus operandi involves
                a scammer using new software and other technology, to clone VFS
                Global’s web page and mask their phone numbers, so it appears
                that the call has indeed come from an official VFS Global line.
                The victim is then asked to verify the number on the official
                website, leading him/her to further believe the caller.
              </p>
              <p>
                The initial call is backed by fabricated job offer letters and
                official looking documentation sent via email. To show
                acceptance of the job offer or immigration opportunity, the
                email states that the applicant will have to make an upfront
                payment and share personal information to take things forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most applicants unfortunately fall victim to such scams, and pay
                large sums of money to the fraudsters in the hope of receiving
                their visa/immigration papers.
              </p>
              <p>
                VFS Global takes such duplicity very seriously and makes a
                continual effort to reach out to victims and potential
                applicants to warn them against such shams.

                VFS Global staff is not authorised to guarantee jobs or
                immigration prospects to any customer. Applicants are also urged
                never to publish their passport or visa application numbers on
                public domains or social media platforms such as Twitter or
                Facebook, as scammers are constantly on the lookout for this.
                Remember, VFS Global never asks for up-front payments via mail
                or phone.
              </p>
              <p>

                in place to protect applicants’ personal data. The company is

              </h3>
              <p>You can usually detect a scam:</p>
              <ul class="simple_list">
                <li>
                  When you receive emails with job offers or immigration
                  promises from fabricated email IDs via personal email accounts
                  (Gmail, Yahoo, .co.in, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                  When advance payments to personal bank accounts are demanded
                  with the threat of visa application rejection or deportation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When you receive pixelated and out-of-proportion VFS Global
                  logo on the fabricated job offer letters and contracts.
