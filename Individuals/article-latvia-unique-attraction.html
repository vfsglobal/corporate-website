              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">In recent years, Latvia has emerged as one of the top tourism destinations in the world. What would you say is the most extraordinary tourism attraction in Latvia?</h3>
              <p>Latvia, being a country in North Europe by the Baltic Sea, offers an opportunity to discover and enjoy the four seasons – winter, spring, summer and autumn. Each season has its own beauty and draws travellers from around the globe to explore the unique attractions. Latvia offers: its Song and Dance Celebration, once in five years Latvia becomes the largest choir in the world, including it in a UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage Festival, amber, wooden houses, fresh food, summer festivals, Art Nouveau architecture and much more.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">How important is India as a market for Latvia tourism? What kind of outbound numbers have you observed?</h3>
              <p>We are happy to see that Latvia attracts travellers from different parts of the world. Even though Latvia might not be the most common choice for Indian tourists, we are happy to observe an increase in numbers in the past years. It feels like a great match that many Indians enjoy. With the growth of students from India in Latvian universities, Latvia is becoming a more known destination for travellers from the Indian subcontinent.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Are there any new or off-beat destinations you would like to recommend for travellers to Latvia?</h3>
              <p>On 18 November 2018, Latvia celebrated the centenary of its Independence. The celebrations will be taking place for five years, from 2017 until 2021. We welcome you to join the biggest birthday party that you could possibly attend!</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">What tips can you offer to Indian nationals applying for Latvia visas?</h3>
              <p>Latvia is co-operating with the VFS Global for the visa processing in India, offering applicants the opportunity to submit visa applications at 14 centres across India. The list of the documents as well as all the latest updates regarding visa processing procedures, up to date, are available both at the Embassy and the VFS Global webpage.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">How will you describe the relationship between India and Latvia?</h3>
              <p>I am honoured to have come to India as we are celebrating the 100 years of established statehood of Latvia and the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, India’s political and spiritual leader. This symbolic backdrop is inspirational for continuing to develop and expand the growing dynamics of diplomatic, trade, educational and cultural exchange between Latvia and India.
                The Latvian diplomatic Mission to India was opened in New Delhi in 2015. Since then our relationship has been brought to the next level, including historic visit exchanges at the highest levels – the Speaker of the Parliament and the Prime minister
              </p>
              <p>The size of our countries differ greatly, though we are connected through our shared beliefs in democratic values and respect to human rights, justice, rule of law and joint interests to maintain the rules-based international order, which is especially crucial as we are experiencing historic shifts in global political and economic landscape</p>
              <p>Latvia is determined also to play a proactive and constructive role in the EU-India partnership as those who really benefit from this dialogue are ordinary people – entrepreneurs, teachers, students and travellers.</p>
              <p>Promoting connectivity, people-to-people, cultural and educational ties between Latvia and India is one of my commitments. I hope that the ever-growing interaction between our countries on various levels would result also in new and direct routes in terms of travelling between Riga and Delhi.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">What do you enjoy the most about India?</h3>
              <p>I have arrived to India just a few months ago and I have already been astonished by the dynamics of the country. India is an experience for all senses! Hospitality and warmth of the people, colours of the everyday life, diversity of culture and languages, yet at the same time the unity of the people, as well as surprises around every corner make this posting to be a unique experience and make every day an adventure! I am looking forward to the upcoming years in India!</p>
