              <p>Among his favourite moments on his Switzerland journey was spending time in the French-speaking part of Switzerland – the Lake Geneva Region, which is a seamless melting pot of rich history, culture, cuisine, wine and music. Here’s Ranveer’s take on the sightseeing treasures he uncovered at this unexplored gem.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Never too far from the movies</h3>
              <p>A special moment for Ranveer was visiting Chaplin’s world in Vevey, in the Lake Geneva region. Opened in 2016, this engaging museum celebrates the life and work of the iconic comic-star, Charlie Chaplin. Exhibits at the museum include excerpts from Chaplin’s films, recreations of his film sets, family photos, and other evocative memorabilia at the Manoir de Ban mansion where Chaplin spent 25 years, such as his trademark hat and cane.</p>
              <p>Paying tribute to his favourite comic-star, Ranveer said, “Being an avid fan of the legend that is Charlie Chaplin, I was eagerly looking forward to visiting Chaplin’s World. This one-of-a-kind interactive museum, once home to the comic genius, is dedicated to his life and contribution to cinema. What caught my attention instantly was his quote on a wall that read – ‘A day without laughter is a day wasted’. It is a philosophy that I try to follow in my life as well. For me, he has always been the greatest cinematic auteur and I couldn’t be more honoured to pay tribute to one of the most multi-faceted and gifted creators who wrote, starred, directed, edited and produced and composed for a majority of his films, making him the most original creators in the movies.”</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Montreux: The crown jewel of the Swiss Riviera</h3>
              <p>Speaking of this beautiful resort town, Ranveer says, “Montreux, also called the Pearl of the Swiss Riviera, took me by surprise. Known for its famous jazz festival, this city on the shores of the Lake Geneva, has been the inspiration for many famous musicians, including our very own Parsi boy, Freddie Mercury. His statue overlooking the azure lake looks like he is still seeking inspiration. The city is an ode to music, food and the good life. To just sit in one of its lake-facing cafes, and watch the world go by, is an ideal way to slow down and enjoy life.”</p>

            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Compact, diverse and full of surprises</h3>
              <p>Ranveer says he was particularly mesmerised by the charm of Lausanne, home to the Olympic Museum, the cornerstone of Olympism – sport, art and education come together through its ultra-modern, interactive facilities. Lausanne is also one of the leading gastronomic cities with traditional as well as avant-garde new-age restaurants. Said Ranveer, “I explored the city by taking a long relaxing walk. Lausanne is a city of contrasts that just beckons you. Compact, diverse, and full of surprises, it is a beautiful blend of the old and the new. On the one hand, there is the city’s Gothic Old Town with its majestic Lausanne Cathedral, which takes you back to an era gone by; on the other, the neighbourhoods of the Chi Chi Lakeside, Ouchy and Flon, reflect the city’s hip, urban culture. I loved the city’s upbeat vibe, its delectable aromas, hectares of gardens, unbelievable views and a fantastic waterfront.”</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">A taste of Swiss food and wine </h3>
              <p>According to Ranveer, you can’t really experience a country in the true sense “until you have had a go at the local food.” A memorable Swiss gastronomic experience was at the Lavaux vineyards, Switzerland’s largest wine-growing region, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Said Ranveer, “Swiss wines are the world’s best kept secret. I experienced these beautiful sun-kissed terraces spread across 800 hectares of land. The dynamic uphill and downhill trails gave me an in-depth feel of local life as I rode my bike through the narrow alleys, visited wine cellars, mountain homes and quaint villages and restaurants. After all that cycling and working up a sweat, I gorged on local delicacies, paired with a spectacular glass of wine from the region, and what a wonderful end that was to our Lavaux trip!” </p>

Always on the move, and full of energy, his work is taking him places, literally. While this flamboyant actor can make any location look good by the sheer force of his personality, as a poster-boy for old-world romance, he has a strong connect with Switzerland, immortalised as the most romantic destination for millions of Indians.
