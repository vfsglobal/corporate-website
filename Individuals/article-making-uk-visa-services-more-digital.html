                <strong>What will be the main changes in the UK visa process within
                  the next one year?
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                In a word—transformation. UKVI and VFS Global have been working
                together very closely in order to create an online, integrated
                application process. UKVI have developed and continued to refine
                our online application form, AccessUK, and by the end of 2018,
                AccessUK will be integrated with the VFS Global website to
                improve the online journey for our customers. After completing
                their application form customers will flow effortlessly onto VFS
                Global’s website where they will be able to book their
                appointment slot in one of our 18 service points across India
                and view and purchase any additional services offered by VFS
                Global which are intended to make their application process
                quicker, more convenient and more comfortable. UKVI and VFS
                Global have also been working to roll out a digital system to
                all customers across India. This will allow customers to
                self-upload their documents on VFS Global’s website so when they
                come to submit their biometrics at a Visa Application Centre
                they only have to bring their passport. Customers can continue
                to upload documents to support their application up until the
                day of their appointment at the service points. Alternatively,
                VFS Global will upload a customer’s documentation, for a fee,
                when they attend their appointment at one of our service points.
                This exciting development means customers no longer have to
                submit their documentation so no more lost documents, though we
                will still have to take your passport in order to place a
                vignette in the passport should a customer be granted a visa.

                <strong>Customer service is a really important focal point for VFS
                  Global. Is the same true for UKVI? How are you working on
                  improving customer experience?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The digitisation move that I have already discussed is focused,
                above all, on offering a more efficient, reliable customer
                service globally and in India and South Asia especially. For
                example, customers in Thimpu in Bhutan can now apply for
                Priority Visa exclusively, because we were able to digitise our
                visa processes and remove the need to send documents on a long
                trip from Delhi to Bhutan. More broadly, we have rolled out the
                AccessUK form worldwide, which is a more customer-friendly form,
                available in 18 languages, including Hindi, Urdu, Tamil and
                Bengali. It’s much easier to use on a tablet or smartphone too.

                <strong>The UK continues to be a preferred destination for travellers
                  in India. Can you share some insights as to the latest travel
                  trends for the UK?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Simply put, the market is booming. Our latest statistics–for the
                year ending June 2018–show that almost 551,000 Indian nationals
                were granted UK visas across all categories. That’s an increase
                of 10 per cent from previous year. Within that number we granted
                450,000 visit visas, welcomed a 32 per cent increase in student
                numbers from India to the UK and saw more skilled work visas go
                to Indians than rest of the world combined. Together with VFS
                Global, we are meeting that demand well. For instance, 98 per
                cent of visitor visas are granted within our service standards
                of 15 working days from the point of visiting a VAC (or five
                working days with Priority Visa or one working day with Super
                Priority Visa)—so we can tell customers with confidence that, in
                almost all cases, we are doing what we say we are doing and
                providing a reliable service to those who apply.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the UK’s official tourism agency, Visit Britain, we see the
                same positive trends too. In 2017, Indian tourists spent over
                £450 million in the UK—that’s over INR4,300 crore. And each
                individual Indian traveller spends on average £808 in the UK, so
                we can clearly see the value of our work. In terms of
                destinations it will come as no surprise that London is popular.
                But other destinations such as Scotland, Northern Ireland,
                Wales, the north of England and Cornwall (my favourite) are all
                notably increasing in popularity too. Next year, of course, we
                will see the Cricket World Cup come to England and Wales. We
                anticipate tens of thousands of Indians travelling for this
                event and therefore are encouraging early applications to ensure
                that they don’t get caught out by the rush next summer.

                <strong>UKVI has always come up with solutions to increase
                  convenience in the visa process for applicants. Which services
                  have been the most popular?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                My experience has been that visa customers care about three
                things—convenience, processing time and cost. And we have
                designed our services to give customers the greatest possible
                choice across these three priorities.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of convenience, we have 18 UK Visa Application Centres
                in India—more than we have in any other nation. These include
                optional and temporary centres that people can pay to use
                instead of travelling greater distances to one of the permanent
                centres. Furthermore, together with VFS Global we offer services
                like ‘Keep My Passport When Applying’ which enables customers to
                travel or apply for other visas during the time their UK
                application is being considered.
              </p>
              <p>
                For processing times, we have two fast-track products—Priority
                Visa (five working days) and Super Priority Visa (one working
                day). Both have proved popular. The PV service is available
                across 10 locations in India and Super Priority Visa was
                extended earlier this year to Pune and Bengaluru (in addition to
                Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai), which shows how regularly our
                customer offer expands.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of cost, as I said earlier, we are committed to
                maintaining a core service for the basic visa fee cost. So a
                customer can choose not to opt for any additional services but
                still be confident that by paying the minimum visa fee, they can
                trust UKVI to turn their application around in 15 working days
                or less. Underpinning all of this is a programme of
                transformation that we are undertaking to improve our visa
                system. This involves investing in our processes, making them
                more digital and efficient, creating and using a new, more
                modern application form and offering additional services with
                VFS for customers to choose. Collectively, this will add to our
                customers’ ease and convenience by giving them greater options
                as to how and where they apply for a UK visa.

              <p>
                <strong>Is there an effort to further boost UK-bound tourism &amp; in
                  what way?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, and Visit Britain are heavily investing in India for that
                very reason. This falls into three different areas. Firstly, the
                ‘I Travel For’ campaign has been running across events and
                social media over the past few months and will continue to do
                so. This campaign encourages people to find out unexpected
                experiences and discover new motivations to visit the UK—whether
                that’s for fun, adventure, food, history or anything else.
                Secondly is the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events
                sector (MICE). This is a large and growing sector, as Indian
                companies seek to build international links and reward their
                most productive employees with travel overseas. Visit Britain
                have started to proactively target this segment. UKVI value this
                group as well, for example, we have a dedicated MICE scheme that
                offers account management and reduced documentation for trusted
                partners in return for carrying out some pre-checks on the group
                travelling to ensure they are genuine and legitimate visitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                And thirdly, Visit Britain are really pushing destination
                diversity within the UK. By that we mean, “Yes, of course visit
                London, but why not find out somewhere new as well?” Places such
                as Manchester, the Peak District, Bristol and the Welsh Valleys
                are all lovely, distinctive places to visit as part of a UK
                trip. And as part of the British Irish Visa Scheme (BIVS),
                Indian travellers can also add on a trip to the Republic of
                Ireland, a separate country with a whole new set of experiences,
                to their UK trip as well. I’m from south-west London so I know
                the capital very well and it is worth a visit, but why not add
                something new next time you go? A huge opportunity for this is
                the Cricket World Cup next year. India will play Pakistan at Old
                Trafford in Manchester next June and we know the interest here.
                Planning the trip–and making the visa application early–is a
                great excuse to visit a different part of the UK and experience
                Virat Kohli and other legends of the game whilst doing so.

                <strong>Since the UK is a big destination for students in particular,
                  how are you promoting student travel in India?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Students–and in particular Indian students–are of great
                importance to the UK Government, and are therefore, one of
                UKVI’s key customer groups. Together with British Council, every
                year we conduct outreach programmes across major cities in India
                to provide guidance to incoming students and make sure they are
                confident in filling out the forms and providing correct
                documents. In the coming months, we plan to hire additional
                staff and expand our video briefing activity to ensure we
                regularly reach more people for this goal. In terms of services,
                we are, together with VFS Global, developing specific products
                for students to give them affordable options to make this
                important process easier for them. The best example of this is
                the ‘On Demand Mobile Visa’. This is a service where VFS Global
                bring the biometrics process to any location the customer wants
                it, saving the need to travel to a VAC at all. Previously this
                has been aimed at business executives, but together with VFS
                Global we are able to provide a more student-friendly offer
                hosted by Indian universities or education agents for groups of
                students who may find it tricky to visit a VAC.

                Northern Ireland has really jumped in terms of popularity in
                recent years. It was a major location for the filming of Game of
                Thrones and there are tours and walks available for people who
                want to relive their own piece of Westeros. It also has natural
                wonders such as the Giant's Causeway as well as man-made ones
                such as the shipyards that built the Titanic, for people to see.

                Scotland is world famous for its mountains, its whisky and its
                history. But there are other events, such as the North Coast
                500, a stunning road tour of northern Scotland and the Highland
                Games every summer, where you can toss cabers, throw hammers,
                and join in a tug-of-war like the clan warriors of the past.

                For me, my favourite place to visit is Cornwall, in the
                south-west of England. It has everything you need for a
                holiday—beaches, watersports, great English food and a real
                sense of its own identity, that includes Cornish, its own
                language!

                It really depends what you’re after. London in winter is a
                favourite of many, with Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park and
                Christmas shopping opportunities on Oxford Street rightfully
                enjoying international reputations.

                If you want to experience something more rural and quiet, you
                can head to the Lake District and Peak District, or picture
                postcard towns and cities such as York. And if you want to see
                snow you can do that too with places like the Scottish Highlands
                regularly getting significant snowfall for most of the winter.
                Up on Scottish peaks such as the Cairngorms, Glencoe or
                Aviemore, you can even do some alpine skiing. Whatever you do,
                my advice is that you pack warm clothes before you go!
