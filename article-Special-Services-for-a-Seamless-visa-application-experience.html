                The key to success of any international enterprise is
                standardisation across geographies. While all VFS Global Visa
                Application Centres across the world offer the same
                best-in-class experience and conveniences, the company’s latest
                centre in Mumbai, India, launched last year, has raised the bar
                of the standardised visa application experience. Every new or
                refurbished VFS Global Visa Application Centre across the world
                since then, and going forward, has the same look and feel,
                ensuring applicants feel comfortable in a familiar environment,
                no matter which centre you visit.
              </p>
              <p>
                That’s the good news. The great news is, as part of the brand
                standardisation process, our Premium Lounge got an upgrade too –
                both in looks and in services offered. Our new Lounges provide a
                world-class service experience, assuring personal assistance
                with all visa related queries, quicker completion of the
                application submission process, and immediate biometric
                enrolment; all within the comforts of a modern-day plush lounge
                facility.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, applicants who opt for the Premium Lounge service
                can also avail several additional benefits to further ease their
                visa application process, including complimentary photocopying
                and photo-booth services as per parameters specified by the
                Embassy and High Commission, and use the in-house equipment to
                print documents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a decision is made on the visa application, the passport
                and documents will be delivered to your doorstep by courier.
                Automatic updates at each stage of the visa application will
                also be shared via voice calls and SMS.

          <p><strong>Premium Courier Service</strong></p>
          <p>
            For all UK visa applicants, VFS Global, in collaboration with UK
            Visas and Immigration (UKVI), has launched an optional service for
            UK visa applicants in India – the Premium Courier 500 – that
            provides an additional cover for the processed passports and
            documents being returned via courier. The service insures the travel
            documents to the value of US$500, providing compensation in case of
            any loss, theft or damage of the passport or documents during
            transit.
