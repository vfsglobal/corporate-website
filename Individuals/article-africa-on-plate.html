              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Kapenta with Sadza </h3>
              <p>Crisp-fried kapenta (sardines) are stewed with tomatoes, onions and groundnut powder, and served with fresh greens. Like other traditional African dishes, it is accompanied by sadza, a delicious maize porridge. The traditional way to eat this dish is to scoop up the sadza with your hand and to dip it or roll it in the accompanying fish and relishes.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Potjiekos</h3>
              <p>Potjiekos (meaning ‘pot food’) is a traditional dish cooked in a three-legged pot. This mouth-watering stew made of beef, chicken and mutton, is a product of several hours of slow cooking. Cooked in layers, it is typically served with pap (porridge), amadombolo (dumplings), or umngqusho (samp and beans). </p>
              <p>The sinewy and gelatinous cuts of meat used in potjiekos are known as stewing meat. Other meats such as venison, mutton, chicken and even fish make ideal potjiekos. </p>

              <p>Bunny chow is a half-loaf of bread, hollowed out and filled with steaming curry cooked with chicken, mutton, lamb, mince or kidney beans.
