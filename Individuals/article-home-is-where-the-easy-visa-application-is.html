                Consider this- if you have upcoming trip overseas, be it for
                business, leisure, education or any other reason, there are
                several mandatory requirements you need to effectively meet even
                before your trip starts, like booking your flight tickets,
                deciding on which hotel to stay at as part of your itinerary, to
                name a few. The visit to the Visa Application Centre is also
                part of this process to submit the required documents sought by
                the country you wish to travel to, an integral part of the
                pre-travel checklist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Irrespective of whether you plan to travel on your own or as
                part of a bigger group, what if you have the option to avail all
                these services at a location of your preference –like in the
                comfort of your home, office or any other location?
              </p>
              <p>
                VFS Global has the perfect solution for visa applicants looking
                for greater flexibility in visa application, with the innovative
                and pioneering doorstep visa service*. As the name suggests,
                this optional service is the ‘home delivery’ equivalent of visa
                services, ensuring the visa processing requirements are met in a
                highly secure environment. A popular premium service, it meets
                the needs of a select set of travellers who would prefer
                personalised services at a location of their choice. The service
                also offers effective processing of group applications within
                reasonable time limits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once an applicant opts for this service, a professionally
                trained VFS Global staff member will visit your home or office,
                and securely enroll biometrics as part of the application
                submission process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The doorstep visa service is availed by companies with a large
                number of staff members who travel extensively, businessmen,
                film crews, student groups, High Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs),
                government delegations, MICE groups and even large groups of
                families or friends who plan to travel together. With flexible
                pricing, depending on the group size, this service can in fact
                be more economical.

                to those who reside in cities away from the existing centres and
                spend time travelling to the nearest centre, which may be away
                from their base location.
