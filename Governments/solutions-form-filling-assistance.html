		<p>Form-Filling Assistance Services, one of VFS Global’s more recent innovations, provide applicants with end-to-end assistance
			with completing and submitting their entire visa application form. This is available through multiple channels – be it
			assistance over the phone, or when at the visa application centre. For select client governments, dedicated helplines,
			manned by trained professionals have been set up to provide applicants with step-by-step assistance and query resolution
			on completing their application forms. </p>
		<p>For assistance when at a visa application centre, the service can be designed to enable an applicant to simply walk
			in with their original documents, and have highly trained staff assist them with completing the online visa application
			form, scanning and uploading documents and even completing online payments with a VFS Global credit card. This customer-centric
			service can be customised to suit the bespoke requirements of each client governments. </p>
