                How early should I apply for the visa?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Applicants should apply as early as possible keeping in mind the
                average processing times and their intended date of travel. Most
                countries accept visa applications up to 90 days before your
                date of travel. If you need your visa in a hurry, you can use
                the Priority Visa service (available for select countries) for
                your visit, work or study application depending on the Mission/
                Embassy. This will put your application at the front of the
                queue at every stage of the decision-making process. Remember,
                using this optional service is no guarantee you will get a visa
                – visa decisions are the sole prerogative of the concerned
                Embassy/Consulate.

                Once my appointment is booked, can I reschedule?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Of course. You can reschedule your appointment (for a future
                date only) and up to a maximum of two times. If you are late or
                have missed your appointment on the scheduled day, the system
                will not allow you to reschedule or cancel, and you will be
                required to book a new appointment after 24 hours. If you need
                to travel urgently, miss your pre-booked appointment, or simply
                cannot book an appointment at your preferred date and time, the
                Walk-in Without Appointment service, available for select
                countries, allows you to submit your visa application on a day
                you choose. Please check with the Visa Application Centre if
                this service is suitable for your application.

                What roles do VFS Global and the concerned Consulate have with
                regards to my application?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Once you submit your application at the Visa Application Centre,
                the VFS Global staff will perform a completeness check based on
                the concerned Embassy/Consulate’s requirements, before
                submitting your application to this decision-making authority on
                the same or following business day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the concerned Embassy/Consulate has assessed your
                application, they will decide to grant or reject a visa, and
                securely return your passport to the VFS Global Visa Application
                Centre (VAC).
              </p>
              <p>
                You will be informed of the returned passport via your preferred
                method of communication, and an update will be provided on the
                Online Application Tracking System when your passport is ready
                to be collected from the VAC. You may then come to the VAC to
                retrieve your passport.

                Can I track the status of my application?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Yes. Once your application is submitted, you can track its
                progress through VFS Global’s online tracking service. The
                status will be updated as and when your passport is ready for
                collection/delivery.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please be advised that VFS Global cannot track your application
                while it is being assessed within an Embassy or Consulate.

                What steps should I follow at the visa centre when I get there
                with my application and documents?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Once you arrive at the visa centre, a token will be issued to
                you depending upon the purpose of your visit. You will then be
                required to wait in the applicant area until your token is
                called. Use this time to go through the checklist provided to
                you to ensure your application is complete. At the counter, the
                submission officer will check your documents, process your
                application if it is completed and issue you a receipt.
                Information about collection times will be given to you but VFS
                Global will not be able to advise you on the time it would take
                to have a decision on your visa made, as that is at the
                discretion of the concerned Embassy/Consulate. You will be able
                to track your application through the website until the time
                your passport is received back with a decision. For a
                stress-free experience, you can opt for the Assured Courier
                service, available at select Visa Application Centres, to cover
                any loss or damage to your documentation and receive guaranteed
                reimbursement if your application is lost or damaged while in
                transit.
