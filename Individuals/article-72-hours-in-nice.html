              <p>Sprawled across the Cote d’Azur (Azure Coast), the endless blue ocean dances with seduction. It lures
                visitors and locals alike to sun tan on the Promenade des Anglais (English Promenade) beach in the mid-day
                sun. Europeans whizz past on fashionably wide streets, headed to Monte Carlo on the right or Cannes on the
                left. Kodachrome images flash through in postcard Nice. To the front lies the vast turquoise-coloured sea,
                while the mountains form a giant amphitheatre a few kilometres away. The verdant terrain in between enfolds
                charming villas, holiday apartments, and a plethora of hotels.</p>
              <p> Facing south, sheltered from the cold North Wind by the mountains behind it, Nice is blessed with a
                salubrious climate all year round. In August, almost all of France is on the move. I don’t know where the
                residents of Nice have gone, but the Italians seem to have taken over the town; in fact, the entire Cote
                d’Azur. Wherever you go, you see cars from Rome, Milano, Torino and Florence; whichever restaurant you
                visit, you hear the sound of Italian sing-song.

                Victory!
              </h3>
              <p>Historically, too, there has been a long relationship between this part of France and Italy. A quick
                throwback will help you understand why Nice is so different from any other city in France. Originally
                known as Nikaia, or ‘victory’ in Greek, Nice was an independent state in the Middle Ages. By the 12th
                century BC, it discovered, thanks to expanding trade through Provencal and Italian ports, the joys of
                prosperity and, because of its economic standing, was soon sucked into the Genoese sphere of influence. In
                1860, the French Republic was awarded Nice as a mark of gratitude for having sided with Sardinia against
                Austria. Nice, no longer Italian, had finally become French.</p>
              <p>Its new status began luring Europe’s aristocracy and intellectuals in the late 19th century. Berlioz, the
                famous composer, wrote “Corsaire”, among other pieces, in Nice. Writer Prospero Merimee initially came
                here to recover from a lung ailment; but stayed on to enjoy the city’s invigorating climate. Guy de
                Maupassant, true to character, enjoyed visits to Nice while unkindly referring to it as “the flower-filled
                cemetery of the European aristocrats”.

                Promenade Des Anglais
              </h3>
              <p>Alexander Dumas, author of The Three Musketeers, wrote in 1841: “There are two Nices. The Italian Nice on
                the hills, full of buildings with carved and painted facades. The English Nice with whitewashed houses,
                where windows and doors are left wide open, people sport parasols and say ‘yes’.” It was an English
                minister who was responsible for developing the long marshy strip along the shoreline into a real footpath
                and, in 1854, giving it the name it still bears – Promenade des Anglais. The mansions and hotels on this
                thoroughfare that links the two sections of Nice preserve their olde worlde elegance. As in the 19th
                century, so too in the 21st - the whole world turns up on this celebrated promenade, including ramblers,
                joggers, walkers, artists, singers, skaters, as well as …pickpockets! Take care of your wallet and
                personal belongings.
                The seven kilometre-long marina stretches from the airport at one end of the city, to the castle headland
                in the east. The beach is covered with sun worshippers roasting to golden perfection, only rousing
                themselves for a dip in the cool sea or a snack. Some of these are private beaches leased out by deluxe
                hotels on the other side of the road. The most famous hotel here, of course, is Hotel Negresco, declared a
                French landmark. It has played host to the crème de la crème of society ever since it first opened in
                1912. Queen Elizabeth, Winston Churchill, Arthur Rubinstein, Charlie Chaplin and Maria Callas were just a
                few of the hotel’s more prominent guests. On my previous visits to Nice, I have stayed at least three
                nights in this legendary hotel. Your football-sized suite helps understand why modern day royalty still
                flock here.

                Old Town
              </h3>
              <p>Known as Nice Vieux, Nice’s Old Town has been thriving since the early 1700s. Charming and narrow lanes
                and streets are dotted with cathedrals, churches, small castles and palaces, displaying their Baroque
                heritage. Old Nice is also home to so many museums and art galleries that you will be spoilt for choice.
                The Place du Palais de Justice is a practical starting point. The central plaza here is home to the
                awesome Bell Tower and the Palais de Justice with its gorgeous neo-classical façade. </p>
              <p>Walk straight from here to the Saint Rita Church and turn left. Fenocchio is the most famous Ice Cream
                shop (94 different flavours!) in all of the Riviera. Grab a decadent gelato and then walk for a minute
                till you arrive at Musee du Palais Lascaris, a Baroque Palace with elaborate interiors, gold tapestries,
                pink stairwells and painted ceilings. This 1,700 architectural marvel is a must visit ! If you choose to
                walk right from the Palais du Justice, within a minute, you will arrive at the bustling, buzzing, market
                place called Cours Saleya.

                Cours Saleya
              </h3>
              <p>In the Cours Saleya flower market, bustling shops, restaurants and outdoor cafes form the focal point of
                Nice’s animated public life. The flowers and plants that transform the market into a immensely perfumed
                garden constitute a major source of income with exports going out to many places in Europe. In the Salaya
                courtyard, an antique fair, full of all sorts of intriguing objects, is held every Monday. Hungry? Head
                for a stall called Chez Theresa, which has stood here since the 1920s. Buy a plate of Socca (a Nice
                speciality), a flatbread made out of chickpeas, like a hummus stuffed paratha. A meal by itself, its great
                value for money.

                Palace Lascaria
              </h3>
              <p>Nec Me Fulgura. Not even lightning strikes me. This is the proud motto in the vault of the entrance hall
                of the Palace Lascaria. Built in 1648 by the 55th Grand Master of the Order of Malta, the palace remained
                in the possession of the Lascaris family until the French Revolution. Sold in 1802, it then belonged to
                several different owners, eventually being divided up into individual apartments whose inconsiderate
                occupants inflicted considerable damage. Realising the value of the palace, the City of Nice purchased it
                in 1942, declared it a historical monument and spent six years restoring it to its former glory. Inside,
                behold ceilings painted with frescoes illustrating scenes from Greek mythology. Among the beautiful objets
                d’art that enrich this small museum are fine 17th Century Flemish tapestries. </p>

                The Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art
              </h3>
              <p>It’s a must-see not just for art aficionados, but also amateurs. The architecture of the building is
                unusual, with four square towers, rooftop terraces and glass passageways between the different sections.
                The reception desk is manned by bright and cheerful staff. Inside, we discover the works of neo-realists,
                of pop artists Arman, Cesor, Niki de Saint-Phalle, Christo and Andy Warhol, to name a few, and American
                abstractionists Berra, Dolla, Cane et al.

                Local Street Food
              </h3>
              <p>The Niçois are immensely proud of their local dishes and (like everywhere in France) have a deep
                appreciation for good food. Available at all street vendors and markets are the tantalising tastes of some
                must-try street-food delicacies: Pissaladière is essentially a flat open faced tart topped with
                caramelised onions, anchovies and olives. It’s like a pizza, without tomato/cheese, with a salty sweet
                combination. Socca, the most iconic dish, is a griddled chickpeas and olive oil pancake, which should be
                eaten when its emerges out of the wood fired oven, all golden and crispy. Traditionally ‘peasant’ food
                served up to the tobacco factory workers, dockers and fishermen as part of their ‘merenda’ or afternoon
                snack. </p>
              <p>Tourte de Blettes is a vegetable-based dessert made of Swiss chard, a highly nutritious cousin of spinach
                and kale. Despite a misleading name, the plant’s origins are very much Mediterranean. It also comes in a
                salty version. Pan Bagnat means ‘bathed bread’, because of the liberal olive oil dousing essential to
                preparation. Think of it as the Mediterranean style of sandwich, with the filling of Salad Nicoise,
                without Mayonaise. Yes, think of hard-boiled eggs, sliced tomatoes, olives, garlic (which is sometimes
                rubbed directly onto the bread) tuna and/or anchovies.

                Zone Pietons
              </h3>
              <p>A delightful aspect of Nice are its zone pietons – vast areas of the city reserved exclusively for pedestrians. During the day, they throng with shoppers eager to pick up stuff from chic boutiques. (You will be delighted to know that the shops are open till 8 pm. Best of all, pret-a-porter is at half the price of Paris). At night, they take on a theatrical, almost magical atmosphere. As early diners take their places at outdoor restaurants and cafes, they are treated to a visual feast put out by groups of out-of-work artistes. Buskers serenade you on guitars, mime artists offer wicked impersonations, break-dancers show off their skills with breathtaking dexterity, and if you hang around long enough, you just might get to see an entire play enacted. Nothing comes free, of course, but nobody minds the 10 Euro tip for entertainment that goes on till the wee hours of the morning.

            <p>Sunshine more than 300 days a year, the seductively shifting shimmering sea, the imposing mountain peaks in a postcard landscape, warm friendly locals, the party scene at night, and international festivals and sporting events all year round, give the city its eternal buzz. I have many memories of precious moments of Nice. So will you.</p>
