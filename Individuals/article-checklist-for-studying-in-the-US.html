              <p>American colleges are among the most famous in the world. From frat houses and sororities to the
                different sporting teams, you would have probably heard a lot about what a student’s life in the US looks
                like.</p>
              <p>Here is a guide to what you need to do before you leave for your education in the US:
              </p>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Make sure your passport is valid for a few years</h3>
              <p>It can be challenging and time-consuming to renew your passport overseas. So, if your passport is going
                to expire within the next year you may want to renew it before you depart.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Apply to study in the US along with a visa</h3>
              <p>You will only be able to apply for a student visa once you have been accepted by a US college that is
                certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).</p>
              <p>Your institute and the course of study will have a bearing on the kind of student visa you need to get.

                  more information from the US government on the different types of visas.</a></p>
              <p>To be granted a visa you will need to attend a visa interview – <a href="https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2015/06/five-ways-to-prepare-for-your-visa-interview" target="_blank">the US government provides tips on how to prepare and what documents to provide</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Sort out student accommodation</h3>
              <p>If you are attending a US college, you can choose between an on-campus accommodation (dorms) or an
                off-campus accommodation (private homes and homestays). Take a look at what services your college offers.
                It may even have a dorm, especially for international students that will make it easier to make friends
                from different countries.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Create a budget</h3>
              <p>Aside from your visa, tuition fees, flights and accommodation, there will be other costs to consider.
                This may be clothes for different temperatures, new furniture or materials you need for your studies such
                as textbooks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Start saving</h3>
              <p>Once you have an idea of the kind of money you require for studying and related expenses, you can set a
                savings goal. It may not be easy to arrange all the savings before you leave. If it seems like a stretch,
                look at possible areas where you can cut back to come closer to your target. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Get a health check done</h3>
              <p>You may need to take vaccinations or undergo health checks before you enter the US. Currently, vaccines
                for diseases such as mumps and measles are required.</p>

              <p>Also, make sure you are able to access any medication you need in the US and do not forget to pack extra
                medicines in your carry-on bag. It will come in handy in case your checked baggage is delayed on arrival.
                If you are have any doubts, make sure you speak to your doctor here before you leave.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Set up your banking</h3>
              <p>How do you plan to access your funds once you land in the US? You may be able to apply for an <a href="https://www.us.hsbc.com/international-banking/students/" target="_balnk" onclick="vfs.utilities.gtm_custom_event('Article','OpeninganinternationalstudentbankaccountUS','Internationalstudentbankaccountlink','custom_event')">international student
                  bank account</a> online or open an international bank account before you leave. </p>
              <p>Allow yourself a bit of time because depending on your needs, it may take up to 10 days to activate your account. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Think about travel insurance</h3>
              <p>Travel insurance may be able to cover you for the duration of your studies, or just the first few weeks.
                This may be helpful if your luggage is lost or if there are travel delays which cost you money.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Check your phone is unlocked</h3>
              <p>If your phone is unlocked you will be able to use any SIM card, which makes it much more flexible if you
                switch to a contract in the US while using the same handset.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Double-check all the documentation</h3>
              <p>Make sure you have all the relevant documentation ready a few days before departure. These can include
                your passport and visa, as well as your travel information and the communication from your college.</p>
