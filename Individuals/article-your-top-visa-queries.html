              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">What is a Visa Application Centre (VAC)?</h3>
              <p>VACs have been established to provide administrative support to the Embassy/Consulate for the successful submission of applications for all temporary resident categories (visitor visas, study and work permits).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">What type of visa do I require?</h3>
              <p>The type of visa you require depends on the purpose of your trip. To get accurate information on visa categories, please visit the visa services website of the country you wish to travel to, that you can access via vfsglobal.com. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">When should I apply for the visa?</h3>
              <p>Applicants should apply as early as possible keeping in mind the average processing times and their intended date of travel. Most countries accept visa applications up to 90 days before your date of travel.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Can I reschedule my appointment?</h3>
              <p>Of course, you can reschedule your appointment for a future date (up to a maximum of two times). If you are late or have missed your appointment on the scheduled day, you will be required to book a new appointment after 24 hours.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">What will happen after I submit my application?</h3>
              <p>Once you submit your application at the Visa Application Centre, the staff will perform a completeness check based on the concerned embassy’s requirements, before submitting your application on the same or the following business day.
              </p>
              <p>Once the Visa Office has assessed your application, they will make a decision to grant or reject a visa, and securely return your passport to the VFS Global Visa Application Centre. You will be informed of the returned passport via your preferred method of communication, and an update will be provided on the Online Application Tracking System when your passport is ready to be collected from the VAC or dispatched to you if you have opted for courier return of passport. You may then come to the VAC to retrieve your passport or await delivery of passport at your preferred address.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">How can I track the status of my application?</h3>
              <p>Once your application is submitted, you can track its progress through VFS Global’s online tracking service. The status will be updated as and when your passport is ready for collection/delivery. Please be advised that VFS Global cannot track your application while it is being assessed within an embassy or consulate.</p>
