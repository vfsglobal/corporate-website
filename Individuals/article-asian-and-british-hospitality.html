                Anantara the Palm Dubai Resort
              </h3>
              <p>
                Exploring a city like Dubai is an exhaustive experience.
                Traipsing through the lanes, drinking in the sights and sinking
                your teeth into delicious food, indulging the shopaholic in you,
                requires a lot of energy and buzz. At the end of your day full
                of exploration, you would want to come back to a hotel that is
                comfortable and feels like home.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anantara The Palm Dubai Resort, located on the crescent of Palm
                Jumeirah, is surrounded by lush green gardens, overlooking
                tranquil lagoons and the beach. This paradise of a vacation stay
                has been designed with an Asian flair where Thai-inspired decor
                has been infused with the spirit of Arabian hospitality.
              </p>
              <p>
                The resort is located on the East Crescent of Palm Jumeirah,
                connected to the Palm by a subsea tunnel, making it extremely
                nearby to the Dubai International Airport. A limousine from the
                hotel will escort you from here. Begin your adventure by going
                for a dip or simply lounging at the poolside, or make use of the
                brilliant gym facilities available and gear-up for your day
                ahead. While you’re staying at the UAE’s only Maldivian-style
                Over Water Villas, take your pick from the 293 elegant rooms and
                villas to soak in the charm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Head to the spa for some self-pampering. The resort’s
                highly-trained and experienced staff will introduce you to the
                traditional Turkish hammam in a plush setting. After a few hours
                when you emerge from there refreshed and energised, make your
                way to the Dubai Marina District nearby. It has got plenty of
                shopping spaces and a plethora of restaurants and cafes for you
                to have a fun-filled evening. You can also head to the Wild Wadi
                Waterpark nearby. When you come back, savour private moments by
                the lagoons accessible from your room while the kitchens prepare
                the best of international flavours for you to sample and indulge
                yourself. End your day with a drink brewed by professional
                mixers at one of the resort’s five bars. You can also book a
                table at the award-winning Mekong, a vibrant Asian restaurant
                with a menu of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese dishes.
