              <p>Famous worldwide for being the habitat of Earth’s most diverse range of animals and birds, a trip to Kangaroo Island is an absolute paradise for nature lovers. There are plenty of things to keep kids busy on a family holiday here. See the wildlife, go quad biking, sandboarding and snorkelling and more! </p>
            </li>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Don’t miss</h3>
              <p>Explore the island that has an infinite variety of attractions, all gifted by the Mother Nature. First stop is at Seal Bay, a large sandy beach and dune area where Australian Sea Lions bask in the sun after emerging from the ocean having eaten a fishy breakfast. From specially constructed platforms watch and learn about a large colony of these rare aquatic mammals and hear them sing as they nurture their young. </p>
              <p>Next is Vivonne Bay, the base of Cray fishing and game-fishing boats. After that, take a guided tour of the sinkholes and caverns in Kelly Hills Caves of ornate calcite formations. A half hour-drive away, the landscape is dominated by the awesome Remarkable Rocks! This is a cluster of massive, granite boulders towards the sea. Over the centuries, wind and weather have carved out the most awesome sculptures from these ancient granite boulders. It’s so jaw-droppingly impressive, like a meeting of the minds of Henri Moore and Salvador Dali! </p>
              <p>Close by is the Cape du Couedic Lighthouse, which was constructed in 1906. From here walk down to Admirals Arch, home to a colony of New Zealand Fur Seals. This fur seal colony now numbers over 100,000. These animals can be observed at rest on the rocks or frolicking in the surf under Admirals Arch – a spectacular coastal grotto. Ranging in size from tiny pups to 250kg full-grown two-metre long males, these fascinating creatures can dive to depths of 380 metres!</p>
            </li>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Visit a farm</h3>
              <p>The locals here love getting involved in your holiday. You can watch sheep shearing or see some of the rarest farm animals. See more than 60 varieties of lavender on the island’s two lavender farms and there are also two honey farms, where you can sample some unique Ligurian honey and honey ice cream. </p>
              <p>Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park lets you feed their kangaroos and other native animals. For a real eye-opener, visit Paul’s Place. You won’t leave without patting or holding the wildlife. If you’re game, the place also has some friendly snakes. The two parks also feature large collections of rare birds. For more, visit Raptor Domain, which has daily interactive birds shows and a ‘Fang-Tastic’ reptile display.</p>
              <p>Have you ever been to a farm where the stock lay hundreds of eggs, have big claws and live under water? Two Wheeler Creek is an extraordinary farm, which produces wine, sheep for wool, native spices (lemon myrtle and native pepper) and Marron – an Australian freshwater crayfish. Here you can learn about breeding ponds, harvesting the marron and then get to sample them in the restaurant right on the farm, accompanied by Two Wheeler Creek wines. </p>
              <p>Kangaroo Island was declared a bee sanctuary to protect the only remaining population of Ligurian bees introduced from Italy in 1886. This cottage industry is emerging as an important part of the island’s food scene. Taste a range of honeys at traditional farm gate Cliffords Honey Farm.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Food &amp; wine</h3>
              <p>If you’re staying at Penneshaw, Dudley Wines Cellar Door is a particularly classy affair. It combines jaw-dropping scenery with a well-established range of wines and local produce. The cellar door is situated 12 kms from Penneshaw on the cliff tops of Kangaroo Island’s stunning north coast. Later explore the Dudley Peninsula. This beautiful part of the Island includes Cape Willoughby lighthouse, Antechamber Bay and the picturesque seaside town of Penneshaw. </p>
              <p>Sip your way through Kangaroo Island Brewery, which is the Island’s first cellar door microbrewery. Offering great craft beer and excellent food, it is located close to Kingscote. There are eight different craft beers available to sample; it’s a brilliant place to enjoy handmade beverages. Head to Kingscote travelling via Windmill Bay and Mount Thisby (Prospect Hill), which is the highest point in the area, and provides a marvellous view of Pelican Lagoon, the rolling hills and the Southern Ocean at Pennington Bay (a wonderful surf beach). </p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Adventure sports</h3>
              <p>Interested in adventure sports like quad biking and sandboarding? Come to Little Sahara, an area of white sand dunes surrounded by bush vegetation. When you climb over the first ridge you are confronted by a second, much higher dune that, when scaled, reveals more dunes that are flanked by bush land.</p>
              <p>A guided Quad Bike Tour with the team at Kangaroo Island Outdoor Action is the best way to see an otherwise inaccessible part of the island. Ride your own quad bike (ATV) through 500 acres of open grassland and pristine native bush, checking out wildlife and stunning views of the Southern Ocean along the way. </p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Learn about island life</h3>
              <p>Early settler history on Kangaroo Island includes stories of seal and whale hunters and shipwrecks. The old whaling equipment and seal skins at the Maritime and Folk Museum at Penneshaw will take you back to those rugged times. Visit the Hope Cottage Folk Museum in Kingscote to see some rare South Australian history. Kingscote was the state’s first official settlement and the museum is in one of three cottages built there in 1856. Take time to admire the old farm machinery, car memorabilia and photographs. There’s even a lighthouse to explore.</p>

At the Kangaroo Island Penguin Centre, the kids will love the chance to get up close and personal with a host of wildlife, including laughing kookaburras or slithery snakes. No wonder that Kangaroo Island is known as Australia’s ‘zoo without fences’. In size, it is seven times larger than Singapore! One-third of Kangaroo Island is protected as conservation and national parks. The award-winning Parndana Wildlife Park here is also famous for its birds."
