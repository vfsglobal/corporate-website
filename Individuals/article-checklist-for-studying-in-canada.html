              <p>Before you move out for <a href="https://internationalservices.hsbc.com/index/overseas-education/?cid=INT:la:D0:IB::1908:004:VFS" target="_blank" onclick="vfs.utilities.gtm_custom_event('Article','Preparingforoverseaseducation', 'OverseasstudiesinCanadalink', 'custom_event')">overseas studies in Canada</a> there are a few things you must get sorted. Here’s a guide to some of the key areas to focus on in the months before you set off.</p>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Check your passport’s validity</h3>
              <p>It can be challenging and time-consuming to renew your passport overseas. So, if your passport is going to expire within the next year you may want to renew it before you depart.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Apply for work permits and visas</h3>
              <p>To study in Canada you will need a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit.html" target="_balnk">study permit</a> – this allows people from other countries to study at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html" target="_blank">designated learning institutions</a>. A study permit is usually valid for the length of your studies, plus an extra 90 days. You may also need a <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp" target="_balnk">visitor visa or an electronic travel authorisation</a>. This should be issued with your study permit. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Lock in student accommodation</h3>
              <p>If you’re attending a Canadian college or university, you will want to set up accommodation. Some colleges and universities will supply dormitories and townhouses; however, this is not as common as in the United States. If you are living on campus you may be able to opt for a meal plan program.</p>
              <p>Other options will be to set up a home stay with a family living close to your school or to rent a property close to campus.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Budget for settling in costs</h3>
              <p>There are a range of things you may need to buy once you land in Canada. It could be new clothes for the cold weather or new furniture for your place. Set yourself a budget that includes all the things you think you may need once you arrive besides your visa, tuition fees, flights and accommodation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Start saving</h3>
              <p>Once you have an idea of the kind of money you require for studying and related expenses, you can set a savings goal. It may not be easy to arrange all the savings before you leave. If it seems like a stretch, look at possible areas where you can cut back to come closer to your target. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Do a health check</h3>
              <p>Before you set off for Canada you will need to get a copy of your medical and immunisation records as well as a list of any prescription medication you may need.</p>
              <p>Make sure you are able to access the required medication in Canada and do not forget to pack extra medicines in your carry-on bag. It will come handy in case your checked baggage is delayed on arrival. If you are have any doubts, make sure you speak to your doctor here before you leave.

            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Set up your banking</h3>
              <p>How do you plan to access your funds once you land in the Canada? You may be able to apply for an international student bank account online or open an <a href="https://www.hsbc.ca/chequing-accounts/offers/account-offer-international-student/?cid=INT:la:D0:IB::1908:005:VFS" target="_balnk">international bank account</a> before you leave. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Weigh up travel insurance</h3>
              <p>Travel insurance can cover you for your belongings, illness, travel delays, missed departure and airline failure. Think about whether this is something you feel would be worthwhile for you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Check your phone is unlocked</h3>
              <p>If your phone is unlocked you will be able to use any SIM card in Canada. This may give you more options when it comes to looking at contracts with different service providers. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Double-check all documentation</h3>
