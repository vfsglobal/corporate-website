              <p>
                <strong>Glacier 3000 </strong>
              </p>
              <p>Any holiday to Switzerland is incomplete without a snow experience. Home to the Peak Walk – the world’s
                only suspension bridge that connects two mountain peaks – Glacier 3000 is a must-do excursion in this
                region. It also has the highest situated alpine coaster in the world – take a cable car up to the top to
                reach the glacier that has snow throughout the year. Or try the snowbus that takes you across the glacier,
                or enjoy a ride on a husky-pulled sledge. The snow, the blue skies, and the huskies can make for a
                wonderful experience. </p>
