                How should one begin writing about Sachin Tendulkar - the man
                who very nearly defines and embodies the love for the game,
                Cricket, in India and abroad. Besides his game, there are
                legends that his friends, fans and teammates narrate about his
                humility and how absolutely ‘normal’ he is. It so turns out that
                the Master Blaster is just like any other regular guy who has an
                equal fondness for home-cooked food as well as gourmet meals. He
                loves impromptu singing sessions and driving around the city
                with his friends, especially on weekends!
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are a few things about the way Sachin Tendulkar travels
                that will convince you that there is much more to him than being
                a cricketer.

                Your idea of a perfect holiday:
              </h3>
              <p>
                Thanks to my career, travelling has always been a part of the
                game for me and is as close to my heart as cricket. Of late,
                I’ve been visiting places where cricket has not taken me. A
                perfect holiday for me would be a break when I can relax with my
                family and friends, and of course, holidays are not perfect
                without good food. After retirement, holidays are more about
                luxury getaways; I enjoy mountains and cold climates.

                What are your favourite destinations?
              </h3>
              <p>
                England has always been one of my favourite family holiday
                destinations, especially during the summer season. We do a lot
                of family activities there that’s otherwise difficult in India;
                little joys of life like going to the park with my kids. In
                India, it is Mussoorie - I love the views and the peace and
                calm. I was in Mussoorie for a snowed-out winter some years ago
                and it was magical.

                What’s your favourite food destination and cuisine?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Apart from home-cooked food, I love Japanese cuisine. Japan is
                definitely on my wish list; I haven’t been there yet.

              <p>
                Oh, Lords, without a doubt! And in India, Wankhede and Eden
                Gardens.

                Any memorable travel experiences?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Several of them! But just randomly, I was watching Harry Potter
                on TV the other day. And it made me recollect how in 2007,
                during the Lord’s test, there was a very familiar looking face
                that was standing in a queue for my autograph. I asked him his
                name and he said, “Daniel” and then I was told it was Daniel
                Radcliffe.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are some unhappy or inconvenient memories as well. Like
                when I was returning to Mumbai from Shanghai and my flight got
                delayed by 2 hours due to which I missed my connecting flight. I
                had to fly down to Bangalore instead and ended up spending the
                night at the airport there. It was not a happy travel experience
                for sure!

                What would you like to say to a first-time traveller?
              </h3>
              <p>
                I think in today’s day and age, the first time traveller would
                perhaps be a small baby! (laughs) But if I have to say
                something, I would say, be adventurous only when you have family
                or friends with you. Stay safe. That, and also meet as many
                local people as possible. They will tell you more about a place
                than anything else ever can.

                Other than Japan... the Poles, maybe. And yes, Russia too. In
                India, I would like to explore the Himalayas and how different
                they are in different parts of India.

            <p>Snow, with bright sunshine. Like in the Alps.</p>

            <p>Mountains!</p>
            <p><span class="bold padmin">Relaxation or adventure? </span></p>
            <p>
              A mix of both. Relaxation mostly when I am with family and
              adventure with friends.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold padmin">Countryside or city lights?</span></p>
            <p>
              Countryside in England and Switzerland. City lights in my city,
              Mumbai.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold padmin">Wildlife or night life? </span></p>
            <p>
              Some would choose wild nightlife, but I am over that now! (laughs)
              But to answer your question, at the moment, wildlife!
