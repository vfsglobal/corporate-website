              <p>With towering peaks and glistening glaciers across the country, it is no surprise that Switzerland boasts some of the most spectacular hikes in the world. Go for the Zermatt Lake Trail to watch the iconic Matterhorn, know Swiss history in Lake Lucerne, or spot native animals like the ibex or the marmot hiking through Swiss National Park in Graubünden. However, there are a lot more things to do in the world’s most beautiful country.</p>

              <p><strong>Discover Lakes</strong></p>
              <p>Apart from the mountains, Switzerland is home to numerous lakes, from the biggest and best known, such as Lake Geneva and Lake Zurich, to lovely little mountain lakes that are off the beaten track. The lake near Kandersteg in the Bernese Oberland has turquoise waters set against a backdrop of snow-capped mountains. In summer, people visit this lake to take a dip, rent a boat or hike up the stunning trails around the lake. The Black Lake (named because in certain lighting conditions its waters can appear very dark) in the Fribourg Pre-Alps is popular for swimming, fishing and stand-up paddle boarding. It is also the starting point for various hikes and mountain-biking trails. The other lakes worth visiting are Trübsee in Nidwalden, Chavonnes in Vaud and Sils in Graubünden.</p>

              <p><strong>Village Sojourn</strong></p>
              <p>If you are looking to relax and slow down, head to the smaller towns of Switzerland. Wengen and Murren, two villages overlooking the Lauterbrunnen Valley, offer access to the Bernese Oberland peaks without the crowds of Interlaken. Chateau d’Oex in the Lake Geneva region is a perfect base for hot-air balloon enthusiasts. Gandria, a village perched at the bottom of Mount Brè, is famous for its wonderful and romantic atmosphere. Morcote is home to several architectural wonders and Swiss heritage sites like the Church of Sant’Antonio Abate, Greek sculptures etc.</p>

              <p><strong>Waterfalls Watch </strong></p>
              <p>Waterfalls may not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think of Switzerland. However, the country is home to some spectacular ones, including the Rhine Falls, which are the biggest in Europe. Located in Neuhausen/Schaffhausen and close to the German border, they are over 150m wide and 23m high. Waterfalls at Nozon Gorge in Romainmôtier and Iffigfall in Bernese Oberland are also stunningly beautiful and worth a trip. </p>

              <p><strong>Where the Wine Flows </strong></p>
              <p>There are many delightful grape variants in Switzerland, some of which are exclusive to this country. Locally known as Fendant, Chasselas is the white wine of Switzerland. It is a dry, acidic and clean-tasting wine, with an extremely floral nose and a fresh, even sparkling, feel in the mouth. Petite Arvine has a vivacious nose of grapefruit and rhubarb; in the mouth, it is complex and round, with a characteristic hint of salt on the finish.</p>

              <p><strong>Take a Train </strong></p>
              <p>With 46 railway companies and more than 5,000km of track, train travel is the most efficient, convenient and breathtaking way to experience the natural wonders of Switzerland. The Glacier Express covers a total of 290km between Zermatt and St. Moritz taking you through different landscapes, valleys, deep gorges, tunnels and bridges. The Bernina Express travels between Chur, Davos and St. Moritz, crossing the Bernina Pass at 2,253m and then entering Italy.</p>

              <p><strong>Sound of Music</strong></p>
              <p>With over 10 music festivals already planned between June and August, Switzerland is the playground for some of the world’s best musicians. Greenfield Festival (June 7-9) is for rock music lovers, Festival Au Bord De L’eau (June 29-July 1) will honour Groove music and the visual arts through local and international artists, and the Montreux Jazz Festival (June 29-July 14) is a must for jazz fans.</p>

              <p><strong>Chocolate Paradise </strong></p>
              <p class="padb_0">Swiss chocolate is known for its quality and excellence. So when in Switzerland, a trip to a chocolate factory to sample this national treasure is unmissable. There are several tours offering visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the art of chocolate-making. Later satisfy your taste buds or buy the best edible souvenirs for your friends and family. </p>
