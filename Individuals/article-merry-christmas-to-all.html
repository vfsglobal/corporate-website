                Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen, Denmark
              </h3>
              <p>
                On offer here are 50 stalls lined along the park’s pathways,
                along with a chance to meet Santa and his reindeers. The stalls
                here sell everything one could need around Christmas, from
                decorations to hot drinks to ornaments for your tree. For a true
                Nordic feel, there are wooden houses, magical bells and
                snow-covered trees. As a 2018 special, an Alpine village
                complete with skis and sledges will welcome visitors along with
                an Alpine express and a merry-go-round. While the stalls selling
                decor and nibbles excite visitors enough, there are three
                different light shows, in complement to a traditional Pixie Band
                playing festive songs, that provide a complete package. And just
                to be a little over the top, Tivoli Gardens holds firework
                displays on December 25, 26 and 31.

                Grand Christmas Market, Montreal, Canada
              </h3>
              <p>
                The market at Esplanade at Place des Arts takes inspiration for
                its theme and decor from some of the grandest festive events in
                Europe. Down the pedestrian boulevard of St. Catherine Street,
                the Esplanade has 60 stalls at your service selling all kinds of
                Christmas essentials like tree decor, lighting, souvenirs, food
                to gorge on and of course, bells and socks and stockings. A live
                DJ at midnight and a craft workshop for artisans for them to
                display their handiwork, join in on the scene for your
                entertainment. Special attention has been paid to provisions for
                kids with an elves’ workshop, Santa’s sleigh and even an igloo
                working hard to keep them busy while you shop.

                Cologne Cathedral Market, Germany
              </h3>
              <p>
                The market at Cologne Cathedral, also called the Dom Cathedral
                market, attracts the most crowd in the city, due to its huge
                backdrop with the imposing and regal-looking Cologne Cathedral.
                Beneath the cathedral lies the largest Christmas tree on
                Rhineland and scattered beyond it are over 160 wood pavilions
                selling mulled wine, gingerbread, Christmas decorations, sweets
                and delicacies, gift items and handicrafts by artisans. Stalls
                brim with trinkets, crafts and are covered in fairy lights. All
                the stalls are red-roofed which makes for a breath-taking aerial
                view. Here, pewter pourers, wreath binders and glassblowers
                gather to demonstrate their art.

                Frankfurt Market, Birmingham, United Kingdom
              </h3>
              <p>
                The largest authentic German Christmas Market outside of Germany
                or Austria, brings Birmingham to life every Christmas. It is
                held at Victoria Square every year between November to December.
                Birmingham has 120 stalls set up in this market selling
                everything from handcrafted wooden decorations and delicate
                glass baubles to hand-crafted leatherwork, handmade toys,
                jewellery and much more! The biggest attraction and fun here is
                Chris the singing Moose. The neighbouring craft market, set up
                at the same time, is at a walking distance and combined with the
                Frankfurt Market to light up the whole area with enthusiasm.

                Winter Wonders, Brussels, Belgium
              </h3>
              <p>
                For five weeks, Brussels turns itself into one huge winter land,
                a wonder of happiness with lots to look forward to. More than
                200 chalets (they just look like them) sell festive fixes of
                glühwein, Belgian beers and waffles, while you bustle about and
                haggle over and splurge on all things Christmas. This carnival
                of-sorts holds something for everyone. You will find ice rink
                and Santa’s village to explore, all wrapped up together with a
                giant Christmas tree. The event is spread out across the Bourse,
                Place de la Monnaie, Grand Place, Place Sainte Catherine and
                Marche aux Poissons. Just warm yourself up with a hot chocolate
                and stroll down the chalets, taking in the sights of happy faces
                glowing by fairy lights in frosty winds. Also, every other hour
                (after dark of course), there is a light and sound show
                projected onto the back of Saint Catherine Church.

                Bank of America Winter Village, Bryant Park, New York
              </h3>
              <p>
                One of New York’s most well-known Christmas markets, hosted at
                Bryant Park, Bank of America Winter Village goes all out in
                European-style as an open-air market. Around 125 custom-designed
                kiosks sell jewellery, handicrafts and Christmas decorations
                from all over the world. Nearby Josephine Shaw Lowell Fountain,
                absolutely frozen in the winters, and the Le Carrousel, add up
                to the festive enthusiasm. Bryant Park’s 17,000-square-foot
                outdoor rink is New York’s only free ice skating rink. An
                exciting addition to look forward to this year will be The
                Lodge, a food hall operated by Urbanspace located rink-side near
                the Upper Terrace.
