                <p><strong>VFS Global's Partnership with Akanksha Foundation</strong></p>
                <p>
                  VFS Global has been supporting Akanksha Foundation’s Shindewadi Public School in Mumbai, India, from a Corporate Social Responsibility perspective since April 2015. The school provides free high-quality education to underprivileged children. With the school having two batches of students passing their 10th board exams with a 100% pass rate, VFS Global has been instrumental in supporting the education of around 500 students at the school.

              <p>For over two decades, premier non-profit foundation Akanksha has been making great strides in improving the quality of school education in India, especially for children from underserved backgrounds. Read what their CEO has to say</p>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">
                Education is a key topic in India, with several companies doing good work in this area. What kind of impact do these efforts have on the sector in general?
              </h3>
              <p>
                India holds an important place in the global education space. We have one of the largest networks of higher education institutions in the world. According to the 2011 census, the total literacy rate in India is 74.04% compared to the world average of 83.4%. Hence, there is still a lot of scope for further development in the education space. Educational outcomes in India are dismally low, both in absolute as well as relative terms as compared to other countries. According to the latest ASER report, 14% of children are not currently enrolled in any form of formal education. For those in schools, one out of four children leave 8th grade without basic reading. </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, the education sector has seen involvement from multiple stakeholders. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in elementary education increased from 81.6% in 2000-01 to 96.9% in 2014-15. At this level, the GER for boys and girls increased by 4.5% (from 90.3% to 94.8%) and 26.4% (from 72.4% to 99.2%) percentage point respectively during the stipulated period. Different not-for-profits, governmental organisations and civil society participation in the education sector has resulted in improving trends over the years. With improvement in the number of schools, facilities in schools and enrollment, the annual dropout rate at primary level has come down by 1.28 percentage point (from 5.62% in 2011-12 to 4.34% in 2013-14) for all category students.
                The Akanksha School Project model aims to improve the quality of school education in the public space and address some of the challenges faced at the grassroots and foundation level for children from underserved backgrounds. Unlike the West, belief in the public school education system in India is very low. Reforms and policies like the Right to Education Act have helped improve enrolments in schools but the bigger problem is that as a system we have failed to improve quality. The current school system fails to address skill building and employability issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Akanksha, we have focused on addressing some of these challenges. Our student retention rate is 97% and student attendance rate is 98% across the 21 schools we run. Akanksha partners with local governments through the Public Private Partnership model. The whole school approach and intervention allows us to have a longer and deeper impact on the child’s primary and secondary school education.
              </p>
              <p>Akanksha schools incorporate a holistic approach to education where the curriculum not only focuses on academic skills but also socio-emotional development of a child. We aim to empower children to face the world and maximise their potential. Akanksha schools function with focus areas on academic achievement, youth development and community engagement.</p>
              <p>Our efforts have proved that our children have been performing significantly better at the State Board Exams (Grade X) by outperforming students in both private and public schools in Mumbai and Pune. </p>

                What advice do you have to offer for companies looking to increase the impact of their CSR activity in the area of education?
              </h3>
              <p>
                It is important that companies partner with organisations that create value for their businesses. It is crucial to follow a thorough vetting process and examine the partners for their work. CSR partners with strong internal programmes will contribute to good outcomes. Identifying CSR partners with a highly skilled and committed leadership team would help deliver quality results. Partners with a well thought through and transparent monitoring and evaluating system help increase the impact of CSR activities.
              </p>
              <p>Education outcomes across the world take time and effort to show significant results. At Akanksha, we focus on student vision that aims to build Mastery, Autonomy and Purpose in all our students. Our vision defines all Akanksha students to have strong values that shape the beliefs, actions and attitudes of a person and this forms the core of our student vision framework. We believe all our students should have the grit to pursue excellence through lifelong learning. We define autonomy as the ability to direct self towards their goals by making meaningful choices through reflection, awareness and seeking support. And lastly, we hope to build a sense of care for their community and collaborate to make it better. </p>
              <p>In our effort to make this vision a reality for our students we hope that our CSR partners, along with the monetary support, can devote their time and expertise to help our students with the support and mentorship to achieve their dreams. As a CSR partner, employees can volunteer in our schools to help children bridge learning gaps or support the school team in sprucing up their space with colourful paintings on their walls and connect with the parents in our community by offering advice and guidance on financial tools to help them invest in the future of their children.
                We would like CSR partners to participate in our project via interactions with the beneficiaries.

                Kindly elaborate on some of Akanksha’s current projects.
              </h3>
              <p>The Akanksha School Project aims at providing holistic education to all children that includes academic skills as well as socio-economic development through active partnership with parents and communities. The Akanksha School model works in public-private partnership to provide quality education to low-income communities. We set up schools by incorporating four pillars for success. These pillars are – excellent educators, progressive pedagogy, parents as partners and accountability to learning. Each Akanksha school is collaboratively run with a strong team of teachers, school leader, admin and social worker. The Akanksha curriculum and Network Support Team empowers the school leaders and teachers with best practices in pedagogy. Each school maximizes all resources like time, money and materials by a disciplined approach to manage the cost per child annually of an Akanksha School. All schools undergo a school development review to assess progress and plan next steps for school development.
              </p>
              <p>
                We currently run 21 schools, 10 in Mumbai and 11 in Pune in partnership with the local governments in Mumbai, Pune and Navi Mumbai.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have an Alumni Support and Engagement program, which helps students with employment support through job search, financial support through scholarships and career awareness through advisory and counselling programmes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have around 2,800 alumni across Mumbai and Pune. We have created hubs and ‘Alumni Ambassadors’ who reach out and help over 240 students every month. 95% of Akanksha school students who have given their SSC exam, are enrolled in college and 70% of our alumni are pursuing studies post Grade 12.
                The School Leadership Academy (SLA) is another Akanksha project that aims to create visionary and transformational leaders who overcome the challenges of educational inequity by designing progressive schools. The SLA programme provides an immersive exposure to all areas of school leadership, which include competencies like designing a vision, strategic thinking, instructional leadership and developing people and culture. It includes a 11-month rigorous residency training programme and internship with shadow training in schools, followed by a challenging selection process. We have completed the first cohort of SLA last year with five successful candidates.

                Art For Akanksha is a project that provides powerful art education, provides art-related career opportunities for Akanksha alumni and generates revenue through high-quality products. The Art for Akanksha products are curated with artwork drawn by Akanksha students and every piece of art carries a story essence of the child who is involved in creating it.

                What are the direct and indirect benefits of initiatives undertaken by Akanksha for the local communities?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Akanksha undertakes a number of initiatives through schools by collaborating with parents and members of communities. We integrate parental engagement, rather than parental involvement that is sustained through active participation within the school as an ecosystem. This reiterates the idea of the school as a facilitator for empowering communities. We have an initiative called The Building Bridges, which aims to build and strengthen the bond between the parent and child, recognising the importance of the relationship. The idea is to improve the child’s socio emotional health and also impact a parent’s mental and emotional well-being. This initiative has witnessed a constructive impact where the school culture as a whole has seen a positive shift and children feel empowered to speak their mind and discuss difficult issues within and outside school. They are encouraged to see their homes and the school as a safe space, which is child focused and acts as a healthy growth environment. </p>
              <p>
                We also exercise a forum called Circle Time in Akanksha schools. The objective of this initiative is to create a safe space for all children where they can express themselves, voice their challenges, issues and experiences they may have faced in their community, school, or home. Through circle time we identify key issues that surface in the communities and provide need based support. </p>
              <p>
                We also have a School Management Committee, which comprises of parents, teachers, school leaders and a social worker. School Management Committees (SMCs) aim to ensure parent involvement in students’ education and accountability for school management. Each school has a SMC of about 10-12 parent members led by a social worker, who often help conduct intensive interventional work in areas surrounding schools, including programmes that raise literacy levels among parents or build awareness about proper hygiene and nutrition. Parent attendance in SMC is about 80% across schools. </p>
              <p>
                We also conduct initiatives revolving around Parent Education and Parent Literacy. Akanksha has created bilingual materials that helps parents to reinforce learning from school at home. Many Akanksha Schools also run spoken English classes for parents to build their confidence and help their children to speak English at home. </p>

                How has your experience with VFS Global as a partner been so far?
              </h3>
              <p>
                VFS Global have been a consistent partner supporting one of our biggest schools in Mumbai. The partnership has helped us successfully graduate two batches of students from Grade Ten and 99% of these students are now pursuing a college education.
              </p>
              <p>
                The team at VFS Global have been hugely responsive and participative in all our activities and this has helped us continue the running of the school smoothly.</p>
