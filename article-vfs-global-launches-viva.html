                ViVA offers applicants round-the-clock support and can currently
                handle 10,000 enquiries per second 24x7, or 864 million in a
                day, thus significantly reducing the turnaround time for
                applicant queries.
              </p>
              <p>
                ViVA is a sophisticated chatbot powered by Artificial
                Intelligence. This means the greater the interaction with
                applicants, the smarter the chatbot gets. Consequently, over
                time, the responses given by the chatbot get more nuanced and
                accurate.
              </p>
              <p>
                ViVA assists with all online visa application enquiries related
                to visa categories, rules and regulations, contact information,
                payment procedures, and can even recommend optional services to
                applicants.
              </p>
              <p>
                The launch of ViVA heralds an era of new-age customer support
                services at VFS Global aimed at transforming an applicant’s
                experience right from the moment they log on to a website to the
                time they receive their processed documents.
