              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Excerpts from the interview</h3>
              <p><strong>What is extraordinary about France as a tourist destination?</strong></p>
              <p>France is a multi-faceted destination offering an exceptional diversity of experiences. With
                approximately 85 million visitors per year, France is the top global tourist destination. This is because in France, each traveller can find something that appeals to him/her, from the iconic Eiffel Tower of Paris, out to the local regions that each have a unique, distinct identity of their own. Travel from the Loire Valley and its fabulous castles and vineyards, to Provence
                and the French Riviera, to the Alps and their world-famous ski resorts, to Brittany and its beautiful landscapes – and that is just a quick tour. </p>
              <p>A kaleidoscope
                of holiday options await the traveller, including seaside holidays, vineyard and gastronomy trails, city breaks, adventure escapades, Alpine retreats and self-drive getaways. Let us also not forget about France’s overseas territories with their unique cultural identities. </p>
              <p>France finds favour with every genre of traveller — from the first-timer eager to discover iconic monuments to the discerning traveller in search of experiences related to gastronomy, culture and art. It appeals to the corporate traveller in search for exceptional venues and locales for incentive moments. An important and intangible aspect of France is its unique art de vivre, reflected in the everyday life of the French.</p>

              <p><strong>Why do you think France is a good destination for Indian visitors?</strong></p>
              <p>France ticks off many boxes on the wish-list of Indian travellers. From discovering popular landmarks to experiencing offbeat activities,
                a plethora of options await the Indian visitor. </p>
              <p>The French travel industry has made concerted efforts to understand and cater to the requirements of this market such as including Indian specialties as part of the breakfast for visiting Indian groups to organizing Jain meals at famous Parisian cabarets.</p>
              <p>Vegetarian food and Indian cuisine have become popular in France which makes it easier for Indian travellers to source restaurants serving meals of their choice. In addition, France is perfectly positioned as a family destination and offers a multitude of choices in terms of accommodation, amusement parks as well as family-friendly activities that would appeal to parents and children alike. </p>

              <p><strong>About France, the France tourism development agency has opened up France Travel Shops in 3 cities in India. How will travellers to France benefit from services offered at these centres?</strong></p>
              <p>The primary objective of these centres is to give out travel information about France to visa applicants who visit VFS Global application centres for their biometrics. </p>
              <p>Today’s traveller is always researching for more information on upcoming holidays that are provided in relevant brochures and maps, and is keen to book services and products to eventually facilitate the travel and help better plan the holiday.</p>

            <li>
              <p><strong>How simple is the visa process of France for Indian travellers?</strong></p>
              <p>Since January 2015, Indian travellers can obtain their French visas within 48 hours from the date of visa application submission. This deadline was not impacted by the implementation of biometrics for all Schengen states in November 2015.</p>
              <p> The new biometric system was introduced to facilitate travel throughout the Schengen area and help issue long-term visas more easily. </p>
              <p>The French Embassy in India delivers a large number of 3- or 5-year circulation visas to frequent visitors to France. As of today, there are a total of 14 VFS Global application centres throughout India to ensure that applicants do not need to venture too far from their residences to submit their visa applications.</p>

              <p>Indian arrivals to France have shown a dynamic increase in the last few years. In 2016, Indian visitors to France touched 600,000. The Indian travel fraternity has been very proactive in their promotion and showcasing of our destinations, by including new regions and varied experiences possible in France that align with the needs
                and requirements of today’s discerning Indian traveller. We are grateful to the Indian travel fraternity and media for their unwavering support shown towards French destinations. </p>

              <p><strong>What do you like the most about India?</strong></p>
              <p>India is such a great, diverse, rich and fascinating country, with the ancient civilization and culture she has inherited, the thrilling present and of course, the great promises
                of the future.</p>
              <p>In addition, the warmth and hospitality of the Indian people are most endearing. I felt at
                home in India almost as soon as I arrived. France has an excellent relationship with India that enables us to build many concrete and ambitious projects together: I know that I will enjoy every minute of my stay here. </p>
