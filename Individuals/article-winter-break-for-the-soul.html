              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Cornwall</h3>
              <p>
                The Western most part of England, with a little bit of land
                jutting out into the Celtic Sea, is aptly called Land’s End. It
                is a cluster of jagged cliffs, promontories and coves that make
                for a dramatic coastline. While Cornwall is stunning throughout
                the year, it is even more ideal during winter when the landscape
                takes on a kind of wildness. Other sights here include the Lost
                Gardens of Heligan, the Isles of Scilly, a cluster of islands
                off the Cornwall Coast where the Tresco Abbey Gardens are bound
                to mesmerise and the Eden Project on the mainland where exotic
                plants are grown in conservatories.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Devon</h3>
              <p>
                In England’s Southwest, in the Devon area, lie two fabulous
                national parks—Exmoor and Dartmoor. These are exposed moorlands,
                which are lush green and carpeted with moss and heather as well
                as exposed rock for much of the year. But in winter, the uneven
                and rugged landscape takes on a magical, frosty glow and
                venturing out early in the morning is well worth the effort. At
                sunrise, the whole place becomes surreal—the skies stretch out
                above the undulating land on whose frosty surface sunbeams light
                up for miles.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Somerset</h3>
              <p>
                Adjacent to Devon is Somerset, which shares a part of the Exmoor
                National Park. It is also known for its rolling hills, rural
                countryside and sprawling flatlands. While the moors and the
                wilderness of the coastline are equally riveting in winter, it
                is the Mendip Hills that are particularly spectacular. Coated in
                frost and blanketed by snow, the whole area looks like a white
                wonderland. Sink your boots in the snow through rolling fields,
                ancient woodland and meandering hills. If you’re up for it,
                exert a bit and climb one of the gentle peaks for breath-taking
                views of the countryside or explore the stunning caves and
                rivers that run underground, or head to the dramatic Cheddar
                Gorge, a jaw-dropping canyon.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Cumbria</h3>
              <p>
                Perhaps England’s most beautiful place, Cumbria earns bragging
                rights for its Lake District National Park, comprising 16 lakes
                and over 50 large water bodies. Besides, it has a series of
                fells, mountains and valleys, which add to the grandeur and
                beauty of the district. It boasts of England’s highest
                mountain—Scafell Pike, and the country’s largest lake—Lake
                Windermere.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Scotland</h3>
              <p>
                There cannot be talk of winter without the stunning highlands
                and mountains of Scotland. The most mountainous part of UK,
                Scotland has an astonishing number of mountain peaks and hills
                and is a paradise for trekkers. In winter, many of the peaks
                receive light to heavy snowfall and are an ideal destination.
                For skiers, there are numerous places such as Glencoe, Nevis,
                Cairngorm, Glenshee and Lecht. Heading to the Isle of Skye is
                also a good idea since it has stunning hills and mountain
                slopes.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">County Antrim</h3>
              <p>
                The northern-most part of Northern Ireland ushers in spectacular
                sunrises and sunsets during winter and the landscape takes on a
                surreal quality. Meander the countryside through walking and
                trekking trails or experience mysterious sights such as the Dark
                Hedges, the jaw-dropping Carrick a Rede bridge or the dark and
                desolate Dunluce Castle. But nothing can compete with Giant’s
                Causeway, a collection of basalt rock formations rising and
                jutting majestically and mysteriously out of the sea.
