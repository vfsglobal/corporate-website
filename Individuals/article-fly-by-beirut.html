              <p>Beirut holds the traditions of the Middle East and the hedonism of the West. This is where the twain meet! Whether you’re looking for ancient Phoenician figurines, or want to visit a night club, or shop in a souk, Beirut has it all. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">National Museum of Beirut</h3>
              <p>The Beirut National Museum has been through a lot in its history. When the Lebanese Civil War broke out in 1975, the museum was on the infamous Green Line that divided East and West Beirut. It was closed in that year and was reopened in the 1990s with over 1,300 archaeological artefacts on display. </p>
              <p>The museum, principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon, is designed in the Egyptian revival architectural style and is coated with Lebanese ochre limestone. It holds collections that date back to the prehistoric ages and go on till the Islamic empires. The artefacts here grace the floors of the building and tell the stories of ages that have passed. Highlights include intricately carved Phoenician sarcophagi and frescoed Roman tombs. </p>
              <p>P.S. To ensure you don’t miss out on the historical significance, the museum offers iPads, which can read the labels against the artefacts, to provide you with a commentary. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Beirut Souks</h3>
              <p>Traditionally, souks evoke the smell of earthy spices, the sight of colourful lanterns and hand-woven carpets. However, the souks in Beirut have moved away from the traditional mould. Destroyed by the Civil War, Beirut Souks was rebuilt in modern architectural styles, with elements of the past such as long vaulted alleys and the Hellenistic street grid layout. </p>
              <p> Beirut Souks, a shopping mecca, consists of over 200 shops, 25 eateries, a children’s science museum, an entertainment area, a cinema complex, street markets and more. Walk the district and you’ll find the most sought-after fashion labels, from across the globe.</p>
              <p>P.S. Perhaps the love for the good life, particularly the emphasis on fashion, is courtesy of the French; Lebanon was under the French mandate after the First World War.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Luna Park</h3>
              <p>Colourful carousels, toy trains, variations of the tea-cup ride – this amusement park has attractions that will thrill the kids. But, even if you don’t have children in tow, drop in to Luna Park for the Ferris wheel. This attraction undoubtedly offers the best views of the city – from soaring minarets and spires of cathedrals to glass encased sky-scrapers, all the way to the blue waters of the Mediterranean. Make it here at sun-down and you’ll be rewarded with fantastic views, as the sun gives way to twinkling city lights. </p>
              <p>P.S. The very first Luna Park opened in Coney Island, New York, in 1903.</p>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Falafel Sahyoun</h3>
              <p>Falafel is a tasty, filling staple that is enjoyed on the go. While falafel is available across many restaurants in the city, Falafel Sahyoun is one of the oldest family-run falafel stores in Beirut. Started by Mustafa Sahyoun, the brand has now split into different branches. His two sons operate different stores with the same name, and they are right next to each other. Whichever shop you end up at, you’re in for a treat – crispy fried balls wrapped in khubus (Arabic bread), with a generous sprinkling of parsley, a filling of sliced tomatoes and radish, and a hint of tahini sauce. </p>
              <p> P.S. There are many theories about the origin of falafel. One theory proposes that it came from India, where deep frying was common, and was brought to the Middle East by travellers and tradesmen. </p>
            </li>

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Night Life</h3>
              <p>Often called the Middle East’s party capital, Beirut is known for its vibrant nightlife. While various pubs and restaurants have opened up in the city, Karantina district houses some of the best ones in town. Alternatively you can also try B 018, a nightclub with a retractable roof opening to the stars. </p>
              <p>P.S. Be an early bird because the entry fees soar as the clock ticks. </p>
