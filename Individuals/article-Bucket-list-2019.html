                Each year puts a new destination under the spotlight: Vietnam
                was hot a few years back, then Greece, Portugal and other
                European countries. Meanwhile, Asian hotspots like Thailand and
                Singapore continue to be preferred destinations for those
                seeking an inexpensive holiday. If you need help planning a
                trip, here are some countries that deserve attention.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Poland</h3>
              <p>
                It’s not a traveller’s first choice when visiting Europe or even
                Eastern Europe. However, Poland has all the charm of a European
                country with an extra dose of history and culture added in. It
                is also a hospitable, friendly and safe country. “There is so
                much history, diversity of climate and things to do. More than
                anything else, it is really affordable,” says independent writer
                Aarti Kapur Singh. Above all, Poland, which turns 100 this year,
                is a must-visit for anyone interested soaking in some culture.
                It has 15 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including museums,
                castles and historical spaces that weren’t destroyed by the
                Second World War (some that were destroyed, like the Royal
                Castle of Warsaw, have been rebuilt). No other country can give
                such an accurate representation of the horrors of WWII, best
                realised at the Auschwitz concentration camps.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Palestine</h3>
              <p>
                Figures published by the United Nations World Tourism
                Organisation’s annual tourism report highlight that Palestine is
                the fourth fastest growing destination in the world. The country
                saw a 25.7 per cent rise in tourists in 2017. Travel writer and
                editor, Supriya Sehgal believes 2019 will be about travelling to
                a seemingly difficult nation, and Palestine fits the bill.
                There’s more to the country than just the headlines—it has a
                rich culture, fascinating history, great food and is a profound
                pilgrimage spot (for all faiths). You can take a go at local
                food (especially the stretchy ice cream) at Ramallah, take a
                guided political tour, hike along Abraham’s Path and enjoy
                Middle Eastern delicacies. “Beyond the West Bank, other places
                to explore are the towns of Nablus and Jericho: Nablus for the
                old city, its markets and street food, and Jericho for the fact
                that it is the lowest city on earth (400 metres below the sea
                level),” she adds.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Uzbekistan</h3>
              <p>
                A recent survey by the Lonely Planet magazine ranked Uzbekistan
                as the second best tourist destination in Asia. Much of this is
                owed to the changes in the country’s tourism sector – visas
                (30-day) are obtainable online, new schemes allow for transit
                visa-free entry up to five days, there are new air routes and
                the rail network is expanding too. “Tashkent is now a four-hour
                direct flight away from Mumbai, courtesy Uzbekistan Airways. You
                can get a visa in merely two days now,” says freelance lifestyle
                writer Priyanka Agarwal. She advises visiting the country’s
                blue-shaded mosques, Gur-e-Amir mausoleum in Samarkand, which is
                said to be a prototype of the Taj Mahal and also exploring the
                underrated vegetarian dishes of their cuisine.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">Iceland</h3>
              <p>
                Europe’s most sparsely populated country is enjoying a surge of
                popularity thanks to shows like Game of Thrones. On its own,
                Iceland is a treasure trove of natural attractions. “It has so
                much diversity – glaciers, mountains, hot springs, geysers,
                volcanoes, waterfalls – it will appeal to any nature lover,”
                says Divyakshi Gupta, a travel blogger and social media
                consultant. Her suggestions include visiting the Reynisfjara
                Black Sand Beach, and going diving/snorkelling in the Silfra
                Fissure—a rift between two tectonic plates with the clearest
                water in the world. “The primary reason to visit is the dynamic
                changes in airfare (Iceland’s budget transatlantic airline Wow
                Air has been offering cheap introductory fares). Earlier
                accessibility was an issue but with airlines offering affordable
                fares, things have changed,” she adds.

              <h3 class="normal_content_heading">New Zealand</h3>
              <p>
                The sparsely populated country has breathtaking scenery, from
                fjords and forests to hot springs and volcanoes. It offers a
                unique South Pacific blend of cultures, focused on the Maoris,
                besides good food and great wine. Tripadvisor ranks it as second
                best in the world for travel experiences, which include a
                four-hour food tour of Auckland and a half-day kayak tour from
                Taup to the Mori Carvings. Beyond it all, New Zealand is famed
                for its adventure tourism. The newest adventure activity is the
                Catapult in Queenstown, which involves being hurled 60 miles per
                hour through the air across the Nevis Valley. If looking for
                something tamer, there is a tandem parasail flight over the Bay
                of Islands, white water rafting on the Kaituna river and rolling
                down Mt Ngongotaha in a giant inflatable ball.
